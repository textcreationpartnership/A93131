         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIs not any ambitious deſire to appear in print, that hath occaſioned the birth and production of theſe enſuing <hi>Letters,</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes;</hi> as being conſcious, 1. Of my own diſabilities to diſcuſs the ſeveral points and particulars thereof, with that learning and judgement, which the great weight, and preſent uſefulneſs thereof requireth: As knowing 2. my more then ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to the cenſures of all parties, by reaſon of that fidelity, and obedience to the commands and orders of our ſadly diſtracted and perſecuted mother <hi>the Church of England,</hi> the which I am perſwaded in conſcience I ought, as far as in Chriſtian prudence I may, to preſerve inviolable.</p>
            <p>For 'tis not the violent diſſolution of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> nor the manifold <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>Schiſms,</hi> that aſſault, wound, and divide this once flouriſhing <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> which can warrant either an <hi>aberration</hi> from her orthodox Doctrine, or the <hi>neglect,</hi> much leſs <hi>contempt</hi> of her Apoſtolical orders and conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The ſad condition wherein now ſhe lies, <hi>ſtript naked of all her goodly attire: Her authority deſpiſed: Her commands ſlighted: The crown faln from her head: Her ſacred body rent, and mangled: On all hands revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and reproached both by</hi> Heretiques <hi>and</hi> Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques;
<pb facs="tcp:115683:3"/>do render her too conformable to her perſecuted, abuſed, crucified Lord and Saviour, to be abandoned and forſaken in her diſtreſſes: although all obedience to her orders in ſuch a ſad juncture of time, can expect no other portion, but to drink with her of the ſame cup, <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and <hi>deriſion,</hi> if not
<hi>perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations may ſufficiently perſwade the Reader how unwillingly I appear in print, if not 1. by way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge provok'd: and
2. In conſcience of my duty enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly mov'd thereunto.</p>
            <p>The occaſion, as it is not unknown to you (Sir) ſo it is very fit it ſhould not be unknown to the Reader alſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt then a <hi>Letter of ſtrange, ſcrupulous, and unheard of Queſtions</hi> being ſent to your houſe, and receiving their ſhort, and ſudden <hi>Anſwers by way of Letter,</hi> under your roof, it was your deſire they ſhould both be made publique, if perhaps ſome of the many miſguided ſouls amongſt us, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction thereby; together with <hi>A Diſcourſe of the holy Spirit,</hi> (intended for the private ſatisfaction of your <hi>vertuous Lady</hi>) for the further clearing of the ſaid ſcrupulous queſtions.</p>
            <p>This firſt Edition being diſperſt, it was the Stationers deſire it ſhould be reprinted; whereunto I the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condeſcended, and withall added the other Diſcourſes thereunto, becauſe a <hi>Reply to the foreſaid Letter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe of the holy Spirit,</hi> hath appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in print alſo.</p>
            <p>Not that I think it either <hi>prudent</hi> or
<hi>profitable,</hi> to have any further conteſtation with thoſe ſtrangely ſeduced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſent that <hi>Letter,</hi> and publiſh'd this <hi>Reply,</hi> or to make any <hi>Rejoynder</hi> thereunto; for that were but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to beat the ayre,</hi> and fight with ſhadowes, they being ſuch kinde of perſons whom S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cals, <hi>Sine<pb facs="tcp:115683:3"/>fine dicentes,</hi> who know no end of vain words, not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing betwixt <hi>reſpondere poſſe,</hi> and <hi>tacere nolle:</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither <hi>knowledge</hi> enough to give <hi>a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> nor <hi>prudence</hi> enough <hi>to hold their peace;</hi> as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure, that he who ſpeaks loudeſt and longeſt, and will have the laſt word, carries away the Bell.</p>
            <p>To wave therefore all intermedlings with their printed papers, which ſufficiently anſwer themſelves by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies and railings: (more then to take notice thence upon what grounds both they, and moſt of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques do build their erroneous opinions, viz. <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> back'd with many miſinterpreted, and miſapplyed texts of Scripture) I conceive it more uſeful, to adde to the doctrine of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> formerly delivered, that of <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> and the rather, becauſe 'tis ſo much objected againſt the former Diſcourſe, that therein Revelation is denied, which is that <hi>great Diana</hi> ſo much worſhipped, and cryed up by all late ſeduced, and deceived perſons, through the miſunderſtanding of ſome places of holy Seripture, which in the cloſe of that Diſcourſe of Revelation are cleared from ſuch miſconception.</p>
            <p>The intention of the third Diſcourſe, is chiefly to lay down ſuch grounds, and to give ſuch <hi>directions,</hi> as may aſſiſt againſt the infection of <hi>Errors</hi> in Religion, the plague whereof is grown ſo Epidemical, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more need of Antidotes, and Preſervatives there-againſt: And this cannot well be effected, but that the
<hi>nature, kindes, reaſons,</hi> and <hi>dangers</hi> of <hi>Error, Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> are firſt to be conſidered, which is the ſum of that Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It is a plauſible and taking way, and very many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and unstable ſouls are thereby bewitcht into new,<pb facs="tcp:115683:4"/>ſtrange, and erroneous opinions, viz. <hi>That there is a far nearer cut to underſtand the things of God, then the ordinary way of ſtudy in the Schools of the Prophets, and of induſtrious ſearch into the Books and writings of the learned,</hi> and that's the way of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>immediate Revelation.</hi> as if there were no more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the acquiring of ſpiritual wiſdome, then to ſit ſtill and wait for <hi>divine inſpirations</hi> from above, without any uſe of thoſe means, which God for that end hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: And hence by crying up <hi>the Spirit,</hi> the Prophets of the Lord are cryed down, to whom <hi>the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,</hi> or of publique praying and preaching, after an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner is peculiar, and proper: And in ſtead of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God for his ſpiritual gifts of learning, as well <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> as <hi>Divine,</hi> imparted to ſome men more then to others, to be employed for the advancement of his ſervice, and his peoples ſalvation; thoſe men are chiefly cryed up, who under pretence of praying and preaching <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> and without the helps of <hi>heatheniſh Learning,</hi> as they call it; moſt preſumptuouſly vent many religious inſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, devout non-ſenſe, impertinencies, and ſpecious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, <hi>i. e.</hi> many good words perhaps, Zealous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Scripture phraſes, but for want of <hi>order, cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and <hi>due application,</hi> conducing nothing either to the <hi>information</hi> of the minde with ſolid ſoul-ſaving <hi>truths,</hi> or to the <hi>reformation</hi> of manners by
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> And not only ſo, but they propheſie lies alſo, and preach many falſe and erroneous doctrines, the deluſions of their own hearts, if not the ſuggeſtions of Satan, and all muſt paſſe (but moſt blaſphemouſly) for the dictates of <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</hi> So that hereby preaching is not only turned into
<hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> indeed, but into <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> alſo: and that holy ordinance intended by God for the converſion and<pb facs="tcp:115683:4"/>confirmation of ſouls in Truth is become (through the abuſe of unskilful and illiterate Zealots) one of the Devils engins, whereby he entraps the unſteady ſouls of men into errors, and deceits.</p>
            <p>And that which further hath added to increaſe this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and plague of the holy, and true Religion, is a crying <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of conſcience,</hi> [which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if righly understood, and kept within their due limits] under which ſpecious pretences many neceſſary and uſeful <hi>Truths</hi> are <hi>decryed,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115683:5"/>It would be endleſs to rake into the puddle of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold pollutions, wherewith many thouſands of people in theſe broken and diſtracted times have both polluted themſelves, and endevoured alſo to profane, and unhallow what ever is moſt ſacred, and dear to all diſcreetly pious, and knowingly conſcientious Chriſtians; whileſt the authors of all ſuch confuſions (with thoſe grand Heretiques, the ſpawn of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the daies of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) are called by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>The elect, the perfect, the ſeed of God, having an unction from the holy One, being taught from above,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon their hearts are ſo uplifted within them, that they deny all reſpect to their ſuperiours, ſpeak evil of dignities, deſpiſe their Mother, (the Church) ſmite their brethren and fellow ſervants with reproaches and injurious revilings; calling them <hi>the wicked of the world; the ſeed of the Serpent; the Reprobate; for whom is reſerved blackneſs of darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nor may we here juſtifie our ſelves, (though perhaps free from the infection of ſuch wilde opinions, and bold heaven-daring preſumptions) as if therefore we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing there unto: But rather in all humility, and godly ſorrow, we muſt confeſs, that both our
<hi>national,</hi> and <hi>perſonal ſins,</hi> have provoked the moſt juſt God to give up our holy orthodox Church to be torn, and mangled by ſuch confuſions, and diſorders: and our holy Religion to be eaten up by ſuch vermin as our own corrupt manners have bred and nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>For when men ſee ſuch as profeſſe the <hi>Truth,</hi> to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all kinde of diſorderly and licentious <hi>living;</hi> the truth it ſelf becomes hereby ſcandalized, and that Religion which ſuch wicked perſons profeſſe is called in queſtion, and doubted whether it be of God, or no. That therefore which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto the Jewes,
<hi>Rom. 2.23,24.</hi> is too<pb facs="tcp:115683:5"/>much appliable to many Orthodox Chriſtians amongſt us, who profeſſe the Law of <hi>Truth,</hi> and declaim much againſt <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Schiſms</hi> in Religion, and yet through their lewd and exorbitant <hi>lives,</hi> breaking thoſe very Lawes of Truth which they do profeſſe, the Name of God is thereby diſhonoured, and that Truth whereof God is the Author, is blaſphemed and evil ſpoken of by the Heretical gainſayers, and oppoſers thereof.</p>
            <p>There are but two waies for the ſuppreſſion of thoſe Heretiques, who ſtop their eares, and harden their hearts, againſt the Doctrine and inſtruction of the Church.
<list>
                  <item>1. A well eſtabliſhed <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government,</hi> by whoſe coercive Lawes, the people may be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the true faith, as to the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof in themſelves, and debarred the ſeduction of others.</item>
                  <item> 2. An <hi>Exemplary piety</hi> in the profeſſors of the Truth, that others may be won by their good converſation to the acknowledgement of the truth.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And now that the former of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The arm of
<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Government</hi> is broken, and the hedge of Gods
<hi>incloſed Garden</hi> thrown down, which ſhould have kept out the
<hi>Foxes from eating up the Vines:</hi> there is no way left us to put to ſilence gain-ſaying, and ſeduced perſons, but to adorn our profeſsion with <hi>holineſs of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and carefully to avoid all thoſe diſorderly and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious manners, which ſcandalize our Religion, and unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bleſſed name of Chriſt, which is called upon us: <hi>Having your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles</hi> (and ſuch as oppoſe the truth) <hi>that whereas they ſpeak againſt you as evil doers, that they may by your good works, which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation, 1 Pet. 2.12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115683:6"/>This is required of all perſons whatſoever, but moſt eſpecially of perſons of rank and quality, after whoſe example even without command, not only most of their Dependants, but even of their inferior neighbours do frame their converſations: Such therefore are obliged to remember that the main end why God hath plac'd them in degree above others, is, <hi>That as their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of place is a ſtamp of the divine Supremacy over all, ſo their ſutable demeanor, ſhould be a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtar of holy and divine perfections unto all:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followers of God in all piety, and purity of life, and action: that therein their people and dependants may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it the leaſt reaſon, why God hath ſuffered this late upſtart generation of Heretiques, to deny that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour which by the Lawes both of God, and man is due to their ſuperiors, becauſe ſuperiors have not given unto God that honour which is due unto him, by being as <hi>Images</hi> of his ſuperiority, ſo <hi>enſamples</hi> of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in all holineſs, juſtice, charity, purity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of converſation.</p>
            <p>Since it is the deſire therefore of all good Chriſtians, that all Hereſies ſhould be rooted out, and holy Truth reſtored, together with a reſpective obedience to all our ſuperiors, according to the ſeveral relations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, without which we muſt never hope either for Truth or Peace to flouriſh amongſt us: there is aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no readier way now left us hereunto, but that every one in his place, and calling, make conſcience of his waies, or in the words of the holy Spirit himſelf, That
<hi>every one who nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity, 2 Tim.
2.19.

                  <p>THis following Diſcourſe of the Holy Ghoſt, his impreſſions and workings on the ſoul of man, was firſt intended only for private ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to your Ladiſhips pious deſires; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well grounded in the Orthodox Doctrine, and having a right underſtanding of the true Spirit of God, it might be as an impregnable bulwark againſt ſo many ſuggeſtions and temptations of the falſe and deceitful ſpirit: For the minde of man, being either devoid of the Spirit of Grace and Holineſſe; or elſe of a right underſtanding of the things of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who is the Fountain both of Grace and Truth; is too apt and prone to cloſe with the ſuggeſtions of the evil ſpirit, who is the author and promoter of ſinfulneſſe and error: Never Age produc't ſo many ſpiritual Monſters, as this wherein we live. And I think few parts of <hi>England</hi> be ſo much infected with them, as theſe Northern parts be. They were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impudent and daring, when they adventured to tempt your vertuous minde, and by inticing words<pb facs="tcp:115683:23"/>to allure your good opinion oſ them; as full well knowing, if they could but have effected thus much, to have made you not an enemy to their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, though you did not cloſe with them, it would have given much luſtre and credit to their erroneous Sect: But God be praiſed that you are better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then to be proſelyted by ſuch Ignoramo's; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſolved then to be taken with ſuch ſhallow delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which a good Chriſtian with half an eye unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd, may eaſily ſee through.</p>
                  <p>It is your goodneſſe (for, <hi>Bonum quo melius eo communius</hi>) to deſire the publique communication of this ſhort Diſcourſe <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> as a Doctrine both ſeaſonable in reſpect of the many ſpreading infectious Errors, ſo much prevailing amongſt us; and alſo neceſſary, as an antidote againſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion which iſſuing out of the mouth of Hell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes moſt impudently and impiouſly to hide its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome under the name and title of the
<hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> I could wiſh the Doctrine were for this end, more fully and ſatisfactorily cleared to the mindes of men by the Pen of ſome more Judicious Writer; This mean Tract the Author in all humility acknowledges to be guilty of many defects and impertinencies, and himſelf one of the meaneſt of the faithful and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſons of the Church: The ſmall acceptance it ſhall finde in the world, will be derived from your white Name and Vertue: in which Sanctuary it may eſcape the black-mouth'd Detractions of the Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and reſt ſecure of the good acceptance, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others.</p>
                  <p>May you be every day more happy in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe<pb facs="tcp:115683:23"/>of all Chriſtian vertues, growing up in the knowledge of God, and perſevering in the conſtant Profeſſion of his holy Truth, and conſcientious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the ſame, till you arrive at the Haven of true Happineſſe. This (Madam) ſhall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant endevour, and is the daily prayer</p>

                  <p>NO Age hath ever brought forth more pretenders to the Spirit of God, then this wherein we live: And amongſt this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, there be many ſo ignorant, that they know not what they mean by that Spirit, whereunto they ſo much pretend: but blindfolded ſuffer themſelves to be led by they know not whom, and with the hoodwinckt <hi>Samaritans,</hi> they <hi>worſhip they know not whom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 4.32.</note> Whoſe ignorance accompanied with exceſſive pride of heart, which makes their ignorance the greater, that through pride they will not know, or acknowledge it: upon this ground the Devill hath ſown his crop and reapt his Harveſt, even the curſed tares of many and ſtrong deluſions: for that ſubtil Serpent full well knows how both eaſily and powerfully to infinuate his Lyes and Errors into mindes unſetled, and not grounded in the knowledge of the Truth; So that moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is that complaint of the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> verified of this people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4

                  <p>Hence it is (chiefly, though not only hence) through ignorance intermixt with pride, that the Devill hath made ſo great a harveſt of

<hi>ignorantly worſhipped,</hi> and ſo their pious intentions through ignorance degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to groſſe Idolatries; ſo it cannot but be an office both ſeaſonable and charitable, as alſo of great benefit, and preſent neceſſity, plainly to ſet down and deliver the true Orthodoxal Doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt, his Impreſſions and Workings on the ſouls of man, that ſo men may have a right underſtanding of this ever Bleſſed Perſon of the the God-head ſo much miſtaken, and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

                  <p>And when you read in holy Scriptures of <hi>being filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>made partakers of the Spirit of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8.17. Eph. 5.18. Wiſd. 1.

                     <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> viz. by his inexiſting preſence, and this in reſpect of his Perſonal Eſſence. If we ſhould ſay then, that the Spirit of God is in his Saints and ſervants here upon earth in a greater meaſure then in other men, Perſonally, and in reſpect of his Eſſence, we ſhould ſo divide and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently define, and limit the Eſſence of God, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided, infinite and unlimited, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Am I a God at hand, and not a God a far off?

But 2. In reſpect of his impreſſions and workings on the ſouls of men, in reſpect of his gifts and graces, which are various and divers, and carry their name from the cauſe or Author of them;
<hi>There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. where the Spirit is plainly diſtinguiſhed from his gifts, as the cauſe from the effect, the workman from the work of his hands; or as the body of the Sun is diſtinguiſhed from the light and heat which is darted and diſplayed from it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid the <hi>Spirit is but one,</hi> but <hi>his gifts are divers,</hi> we may hence obſerve; that if we ſhould confound the Spirit of God with the gifts and qualifications diſpenſed from him, we ſhould be ſo far from acknowledging and worſhipping the true God, which is but one, that we ſhould fall into that groſſe Idolatry of the Heathens of old, making as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spirits of God, as they made gods, who deified the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues, and worſhipped their ſeveral vertuous qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as gods.</p>
                  <p>The unwary neglect of this diſtinction, betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and qualifications of Gods Spirit, is that very rock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many a miſguided and unſtable ſoul, hath ſuffered the ſhipwrack of the true Chriſtian Faith; for being by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuggeſtion of the ſpirit of Lyes once perſwaded in their hearts, that they have the Spirit of God, and that perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abiding in them, they are hereupon puft up with ſuch an exceſſive ſpiritual pride, and ſelf-conceited eminence, as not only to exalt themſelves above, and deſpiſe their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brethren, who are better qualified, then themſelves: but even to extol themſelves above the heavens, and moſt blaſphemouſly to profeſſe and boaſt of an equality with God; a blaſphemy however 'tis ſalved and minc't, that cannot be paralleld, but with that originall pride of the Devil, <hi>He ſaid in his heart, I will be like the moſt High:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and to this he tempted our firſt Parents, perſwading them to rebel againſt their Maker, and become <hi>as Gods</hi> themſelves, <hi>knowing good and evil;</hi> this was the very ſin, that hurled <hi>Lucifer</hi> like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115683:30"/>Lightning from Heaven, his pride and preſumption to be like the moſt High, and therefore with all his Apoſtate crew he is now
<hi>reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſſe, to the judgement of the Great day.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> And for our new Sect of
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts,</hi> had they the Spirit of God, as they pretend, abiding in them, and ſpeaking in them Perſonally and Eſſentially, this blaſphemy muſt neceſſarily follow, that they are equal with God, in reſpect of the Spirit in them, as themſelves affirm it, though not as
<hi>George Robert,</hi> &amp;c. To avoid which blaſphemy and many other abſurd and wicked opinions of the like nature, which would follow thereupon, and wherwith too many unſtable ſouls are now infected, we muſt remember that to have the Spirit in the language of the Scripture, is not to be underſtood of his perſonal Eſſence, but of his qualifications.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt kinde of the holy Spirits impreſſions, are his

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115683:33"/>manner he works upon our hearts: Only, 2. we know him by his effects and workings: as when he moves and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the ſoul to what is holy, juſt, and good; or when he ſhakes the heart into contrition, compunction, and godly ſorrow for ſin; or when he raiſeth the minde out of the duſt, and rubbiſh of earthly vanities, and mounts it upon the wings of heavenly deſires and meditations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 3. as when we ſee no ſtirring, no moving of the air, but all is calm and ſtill, we ſay there is no winde: ſo when there is no good motions or deſires within us, no inclinations to piety, or charity, no godly contrition for ſin, no riſing of the minde towards heaven, nor breathing after things divine and heavenly; we may well ſay, that ſoul is becalmed, the Spirit of God is not there, neither hath the heavenly winde of the Almighty breathed therein.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>graces</hi> of Gods Spirit, repreſented by the

<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe as material fruits grow not, but upon trees; neither do theſe graces grow in the ſoul, but upon the tree of life,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.4,5. <hi>As the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me; I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>

                        <item> 2. The end of the Spirit in diſtributing his gifts would be fruſtrate: for how ſhall one member profit another, which is the end of theſe gifts, when all men have the ſame gifts?</item>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115683:37"/>of men by proper and peculiar Profeſſors, Artiſts and Miniſters: How then ſhould we think that Religion, which is the Art of Arts, may lye in common, and be expoſed to the profanation of every rude illiterate and unskilful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick; to be unhallowed by the rude intermedlings of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning perſons, and not rather ſeparate from profane and vulgar touch, by ſelect, diſtinct, and qualified perſons, for that end by God ordained? Who dares take upon him to raiſe forces, to impoſe taxes, to levie contributions, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh offenders, or the like, but ſuch only who are deſigned thereunto, and have commiſſion for it? And yet in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, in the diſpenſation of his holy myſteries, every man will be a Prieſt, and a Prophet, as if it were pardonable only to be diſorderly in Religion, or as if God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a lawleſs liberty in thoſe things wherein the frailty of man is moſt apt, and too likely to miſcarry, and wherein alſo the miſcarriage is moſt fatal, and ruinous to the ſoul for ever.</p>
                  <p>In Religion it is true, that all have a common intereſt, and ſo they have in the Lawes alſo: and by the ſame reaſon, that the one, by the ſame the other alſo, may be diſpenſed by all men promiſcuouſly without order, without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt neceſſarily end in confuſion.

                  <p>Secondly, for the manner, the Apoſtles were endued with their fulneſſe of ſpiritual gifts miraculouſly; their Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did publickly and viſibly appear to be by miracle and immediate from Heaven,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. But we, as we can pretend unto no ſuch extraordinary gifts; ſo neither do we pretend unto, or depend upon any ſuch extraordinary and immediate infuſion of ſpiritual gifts; but ordinarily &amp; in the uſe of means, even by much ſtudy, labour, and induſtry in the waies of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning and knowledge, we do acquire our qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: according to the command of the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> we <hi>ſtudy</hi> for them, 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.15.</note> and yet <hi>Timothy</hi> ſure had leſs need to ſtudy for his gifts, then any of us, as having more of immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration then the beſt of men can hope for ſince.</p>
                  <p>And yet though we ſtudy to be qualified for the work of the Miniſtry; our qualifications are ſtill the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115683:40"/>all our <hi>wiſdome</hi> and knowledge is <hi>from above:</hi> even as of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children, it is recorded that <hi>God gave them knowledge and underſtanding in all learning and wiſdome, Dan.</hi> 1.17.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.17.4.</note> And yet it is ſaid before verſ. the 4. that <hi>they were brought up and inſtructed in knowledge</hi> (and that by and among the Heathen too) <hi>and were taught the learning and tongue of the Caldaeans;</hi> So our humane learning, tongues and languages (ſo much declaimed againſt by the ignorant) are the Handmaids to ſpiritual and Divine wiſdome and knowledge, and both the one and the other, though acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by inſtruction and ſtudy in the Schools of the Prophets, are yet of Gods mercifull donation, they are ſtill the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And that firſt, becauſe from the Spirit of God it is that we have mindes capable, and mindes inclinable to uſe the means, for the attainment of ſuch gifts: for even our natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and moral qualifications are gifts of the Spirit; perſpicacity, quickneſs of wit, ripeneſs of judgement, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſtudious, diligent and induſtrious minde in the ſearch and dexterity, in the diſcovery of the ſeveral waies of learning and knowledge, even all of them are the gifts of God; <hi>for every good and perfect gift,</hi> whether natural, moral, or divine,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17. Joh. 3.27.</note> 
                     <hi>cometh down from above, Jam.</hi> 1.17. for <hi>a man can receive nothing except it be given from above, Joh.</hi> 3.27. The very ſpeaking of an ordinary revealed Truth is called a ſpeaking <hi>by the Spirit, for no man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, but by the Spirit of God;</hi> becauſe the revelation of this, as of every truth, is from the <hi>Spirit</hi> originally, and from him alſo is both the power and the act of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our qualifications though acquired by ſtudy, are yet the gifts of the Spirit, becauſe it is by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and the influence of his good Spirit upon our ſtudies and endevours, that we do acquire theſe qualifications: and it is generally, and for the moſt part, that God diſtributes his gifts and bleſſings according to mens inclinations, apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and endevours for the reception of his gifts.
<hi>Habitus infuſi infunduntur per modum acquiſitorum:</hi> All infuſed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115683:40"/>
                     <hi>gifts,</hi> are infuſed after the manner of gifts acquired, <hi>i.e.</hi> as we are more or leſſe induſtrious to acquire the <hi>gifts</hi> of the Spirit, accordingly ſo they are more or leſſe given, and communicated to us by the Spirit: which is ſignified unto us by the parable of the hidden Treaſure, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13.4. <hi>The Kingdome of heaven is like unto a treaſure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth and ſelleth all that he hath and buyeth that field:</hi> The treaſure found without ſearch, denoteth Gods free and gratuitous revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf unto us: and the ſelling of all to buy that field, ſignifies a mans utmoſt endevours, and labours to be made partaker of theſe divine Revelations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the qualifications acquired by ſtudy, are by the Spirit of God himſelf directed to the ends of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are
<hi>to profit withall;</hi> and then is Gods bleſſing the greater, and the influence of his Spirit upon our ſtudies, the more effectual and powerful, when we have in them no other aim or intention, but to be thereby enfitted and enabled to become uſefull inſtruments of Gods ſervice, and his peoples edification. And both in that we do direct our ſtudies to this end, and alſo imploy our gifts acquired by ſtudy to this end alſo, it is from the Spirit of God: who <hi>works in us to will and to do of his own God pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2.15.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, all this is acknowledged, that our gifts in all theſe reſpects are from the Spirit of God, though ſtudied for; In that together with thoſe means that are outward and moral, we uſe the Divine means alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> prayer and devotion, commanded <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15.
<hi>If any man lacks wiſdome, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Miniſters of the Goſpell notwithſtanding their gifts are from the Spirit, are yet bound to uſe all means, both Moral and Divine, for the acquiring thereof; is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt even from Gods own example in the uſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: In that God himſelf who is not tyed to means, neither hath need of any, is yet pleaſed to uſe the means and Miniſtry of ſome men for the inſtruction and converſion of others; There is no queſtion, but he who at the firſt created man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115683:41"/>his own Image, could without the Miniſtry of man, have again repaired the decayes of his bleſſed Image in man: But yet in all ages it hath ſeemed good to his infinite wiſdome to uſe the mediation and Miniſtry of men herein; And this he doth out of his tender reſpect to mens infirmities, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vaſt diſtance betwixt God and man;<note place="margin">Exod. 20.19.

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe are the properties of Gods Spirit, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inſpirations are,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>from heaven,</hi> as being the Spirit of God, who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115683:52"/>dwelleth in the heavens, and to heaven-ward wings and raiſes the ſoul which he inſpires.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it <hi>filled the houſe</hi> where they were ſitting: ever tends to the good of the Church,<note place="margin">1 Pet.
2.5.</note> which is the <hi>houſhold of faith:</hi> This heavenly winde never blowes, but for the good of Gods houſhold; therefore are his people called <hi>a ſpiritual houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the two firſt of theſe qualities, 'twill be a hard matter to diſtinguiſh a falſe ſpirit from the Spirit of truth: For as it is ordinary and common to every winde, to be both ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and vehement; ſo
'tis common to every ſpirit alſo, both true and falſe; nay, commonly falſe and faigned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are more violent and vehement, and make a greater noiſe and ſtir in the world then the true Spirit doth; and there is good reaſon for it: for the falſe ſpirit wanting the native ſtrength and genuine efficacy of the truth to ſupport it, flies therefore to force and violence, earneſt zeal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to bear up in the mindes and good opinions of the world.</p>
                  <p>For the tryal of ſpirits then, according to this rule, we muſt look upon the two other properties of this divine winde, which are not ordinary, and common, and not natural to that winde which blowes in the air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>it came from heaven</hi>] Windes do not naturally come from heaven, but out of the caves and hollowes of the earth, or out of the middle region of the air; neither do they blow
<hi>deſurſum,</hi> downwards, as this winde did, but laterally, from one coaſt or climate to another; but this winde came directly downwards, and
<hi>de coelo,</hi> from heaven it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it <hi>filled the houſe</hi> where they were ſitting, and no houſe but that: The winde naturally blowes upon all places alike, within its circuit; but this winde blew electively as it were, and by diſcretion, making choice of one place only to blow upon, and no other; ſo that in both theſe reſpects it is manifeſt it was a winde extraordinary and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe two properties we may try and examine, both the truth of our own, and of the ſpirits of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:115683:53"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If firſt, thoſe deſires, opinions, and actions which relate to Religion, be from above, if the ground thereof be fetcht <hi>de coelo,</hi> from heaven; ſo that they tend to make us heavenly minded, to wean our hearts from the world, to elevate and raiſe up our affections to things above, to form and frame our converſations towards heaven.<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If ſecondly, they keep us within the pale and limits of the Church, if they tend to the general benefit, edification, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and good of the houſhold of faith; and to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of peace, and love, and unity amongſt Chriſtians, we may then be confident it is the heavenly winde, the divine breath of the Almighty, the holy Spirit of God that inſpires them.</p>
                  <p>But if otherwiſe theſe motions and opinions that ſeem religious be either, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, grounded upon earthly and worldly reſpects, have their private aims and intentions, either of ambition, vain-glory, and popular applauſe, as in ſome, or of worldly profit, benefit, and preferment, as in others; or of hatred, malice, revenge, as in a third ſort of men: or if, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, they tend to diviſions, ſchiſme, ſeparation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, variance, malice, hatred, envie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If either they ſmell rank of the world, or taſte of any fruits of the fleſh, recorded Gal. 5.19. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adultery, fornication,</hi> &amp;c. Then this winde comes ſurely not from heaven, there is nothing in it but what is either natural, or worſe, ſuggeſted by the ſpirit of error: 'Tis either a revelation of fleſh and bloud, ariſing out of the caves and hollowes of an earthly minde; or elſe it is inſpired and blown from thoſe regions of the air which are the habitation of unclean ſpirits: 'Tis not <hi>defluxus coeli,</hi> a divine breath inſpired from heaven, but either <hi>exhalatio terrae,</hi> a terrene exhalation drawn from the hollows of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart, or a blaſt from the ſpiritual powers of the air, a ſuggeſtion of Satan.</p>
                  <p>And by this rule alſo, every man may try himſelf, whether he be truly ſanctified by the Spirit of God, or not. He that ſhall find his ſoul poſſeſt with motions, and deſires, weaned from all the pomps, and vanities, profits pleaſures, and<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115683:53"/>cares of the world, hungring, and thirſting, and breathing after heaven, whoſe ſoul dwels more in heaven, then on earth, whoſe affections are ſet on things above, and not on things below, may be well aſſured of the Spirit of God dwelling in him. For all ſuch motions, and deſires are but ſparks of that heavenly fire, the flame whereof is mindful of its own original, ever mounts the ſoul aloft, works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its own center, and tends to the place from whence it comes: To denote which aſcending quality of the Spirit of Grace, is one reaſon more why the holy Ghoſt is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>fire,</hi> Mat.
3.11. Becauſe 'tis the property of fire, both flame and ſmoke, to mount upward; ſo 'tis the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every heavenly inſpired ſoul, to aſcend both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and deſires: neither the more pure, nor yet the more droſſie part of the ſoul cleaves unto the duſt, and continually dwels below, that is endued with <hi>power from above,</hi> or with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. And for the ſame reaſon, amongſt others alſo, the holy Ghoſt is repreſented by water, Joh. 7.38,39. becauſe, as
'tis the property of water, even againſt its own nature, to aſcend as high, as is the place from whence it deſcends; ſo, even againſt the ſtream of natural corruption, the ſoul is mounted to heaven by the influence of Gods ſpirit, who cometh down from heaven. And the wings which the holy Spirit hath for this aſcenſion and flight, are devout and fervent prayers, divine and celeſtial meditations and deſires.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. MAn being created after the Image of God, was undoubtedly at the firſt endued with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of divine truth, as was neceſſary to the attainment of that felicity, whereunto God created him <hi>(viz.)</hi> the beatifical viſion and fruition of his Creator for ever: For as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> do affirm, <hi>If it were poſſible that the inviſible and all ſpiritual God, could be repreſented under any viſible or compounded ſhape, and being: His body then muſt needs be compoſed of Light, and his ſoul of Truth:</hi> So eſſential to the very being of God, is knowledge and truth: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to the being of man after the <hi>image of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this light of divine knowledge, was by mans diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience too ſoon eclipſt, and his ſoul involv'd in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>ſinfulneſs, ignorance,</hi> and <hi>error:</hi> our firſt parents out of a ſawcy ambitious affectation, to know what they ought not, engulft themſelves, and all their poſterity, into a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural blindneſs and ignorance of what they ought to know; ſo that ever ſince,
<hi>hoc tantum ſcimus, quòd nihil ſcimus:</hi> the moſt knowing man, knowes beſt his own ignorance, and want of knowledge: <hi>For if any man think he knows any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſince without the knowledge of God, and of his moſt holy will, that perfection of our being whereunto<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115683:62"/>God hath created us, cannot be attained, Joh. 17.3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it pleaſed God to reſtore our firſt faln parents in ſome meaſure to the knowledge of himſelf, and of his will in the waies of his worſhip: and this he did either <hi>immediately</hi> by himſelf, or by the <hi>mediation</hi> of intervening Angels, by the voice from heaven convey'd upon the wings of the winde, for ſo we read Gen. 3.8. <hi>And they heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool,</hi> or <hi>in the winde of the day:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Junins in loc.</note> winde conveying his voice into their ears, and thereby his into their hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By vertue of this <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> or ſome others not recorded in holy Writ, <hi>Adam</hi> received from God both the knowledge of that religious ſervice and obedience which God then required from man, and therewithall the honour of the Prieſthood alſo: being as the firſt man, ſo the firſt Prieſt in the world.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the proof of the firſt, thoſe Lawes of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which were given by God to <hi>Adam,</hi> and from <hi>Adam</hi> transferred to his Sons and poſterity, though they be not clearly expreſſed in holy Scripture (becauſe as the worſhip of God grew up with time to more perfection, ſo the leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was the leſs regarded) yet in many places of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture theſe Lawes are, though but obſcurely, intimated: and by the Jewes with one common conſent they are reduc't to ſix heads.

3.41.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus then in the firſt age of the world, the knowledge of God in the waies of his worſhip, together with the office of
<hi>Prieſthood,</hi> was tranſmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> to his ſons, and ſo from <hi>Patriarch</hi> to <hi>Patriarch</hi> in all generations: The ſeveral bodies of reſpective families being not by <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> but by the <hi>indoctrination</hi> and <hi>inſtruction</hi> of the heads of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies taught the waies of Gods ſervice, and their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor do we read of any divine truths <hi>immediately revealed,</hi> or any divine lawes by <hi>immediate revelation</hi> preſcribed from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi> which was the ſpace of 1500 years. The Propheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> remembred of S. <hi>Jude,</hi> being not of the nature of any new truths revealed, but a denuntiation of judgement to be inflicted.</p>
                  <p>In all this long tract of time, the world being drown'd in ſinfulneſs and iniquity, it was revealed to <hi>Noah,</hi> that the earth ſhould be drown'd by a floud alſo, and the ſinfull pollutions thereof waſhed away by an univerſal deluge of waters,<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115683:63"/>Gen.
6.12,13. <hi>And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth: And God ſaid unto</hi> Noah,
<hi>the end of all fleſh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and behold I will deſtroy them with the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. 'Twas not all the people, 'twas not any we read of but <hi>Noah</hi> only, had this truth <hi>immediately revealed unto him: Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> indeed tels us, that the <hi>ſons</hi> of <hi>Seth</hi> received by <hi>traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> (not by <hi>immediate revelation</hi>) that the world ſhould be twice deſtroyed, once by

                  <p n="11">11. But the time when the firſt of theſe univerſal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhould happen, <hi>Noah</hi> only had the honour to receive
<hi>immediately</hi> from God: And for this end 'twas <hi>revealed</hi> to him, that by his <hi>mediation</hi> and <hi>miniſtery</hi> the people might have the knowledge of it, and be ſtir'd up by his <hi>preaching</hi> (not by

                  <p n="12">12. Unto <hi>Noah,</hi> after the floud was dryed up, the foreſaid Lawes of holy living, given unto <hi>Adam</hi> were now renewed: adding thereunto a prohibition againſt eating of bloud, to deterre them from the ſin of murther before prohibited, Gen. 9.4. <hi>But fleſh with the life thereof, i. e.</hi> the bloud <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhalt thou not eat.</hi> And this with the ſix former commands are commonly cal'd and known by the name of the

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115683:63"/>13. From <hi>Noah</hi> the
<hi>Prieſthood</hi> deſcended upon his ſon <hi>Shem,</hi> who was the firſt of all men that had God as 'twere entayled upon himſelf in a more ſpecial reſerved ſort of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar perſonal appropriation: For until the daies of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the great Lord of the world, and of all things therein, was peculiarly ſtyled, <hi>the Lord God of</hi> Shem, Gen. 9.26.</p>

<hi>Abraham,</hi> were to be taught the knowledge of God, and of his holy Lawes: upon this very ground God himſelf affirms himſelf to have revealed his will unto him: Gen. 18.17, &amp;c. <hi>And God ſaid, Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the things that I do, &amp;c. For I know him, that he will command his children and his houſhold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. From <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the knowledge of God was by <hi>tradition</hi> tranſmitted from Patriarch to Patriarch, and the Church or people of God, now confin'd to the ſeed of Iſrael, was by the ſeveral heads of their reſpective families inſtructed in the ſervice of God, till turning away after the Idols of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> God gave them up to a cruel bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very under the tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> In which great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>when they beſought the Lord, he ſent redemption to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the hands of</hi> Moſes <hi>his ſervant, and</hi> Aaron <hi>whom he had choſen,</hi> Pſal. 105.25,26.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ſelected, and immediately call'd by God, as to be the leader and deliverer of his people, ſo his Law-giver alſo, who receiving the minde of God by <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> made it known unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The ſum whereof was engraven in tables of ſtone, and commanded to be kept as the ſtanding rule of Gods worſhip, and mans obedience to all poſterity: and the people were herein ſo far from depending upon <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> that they petition'd to receive the minde of God by the

                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The Law of God thus publiſhed and ſtanding upon record, there was now leſſe need of <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> then before: the people of God had now <hi>a more ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,</hi> then what formerly, 1. By <hi>revelation</hi> from heaven, 2. By
<hi>tradition</hi> from Patriarch to Patriarch was delivered. To theſe ſacred writings therefore they were commanded to have recourſe: by them to be guided and directed, and not<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115683:64"/>to ſwerve from what was contained therein, <hi>either to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> Joſh.
1.7. <hi>To the Law, to the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, 'tis becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20. Where all pretence to new lights is cut off, and that pronounc't to be no true light, which is not grounded on the Lawes of God.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For the preſervation of this law pure, and inviolate, a miniſtery or prieſthood was ordained, and by Gods ſpecial command transferr'd from the firſt born of every Tribe upon the Tribe of
<hi>Levi.</hi> To them belonged the interpretation of the Law, and the performance of all the ſacred rites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, neither were the people either preſumptuouſly to depend upon <hi>immediate revelation</hi> in reſpect of the one, or ſacrilegiouſly entermeddle with any part of the
<hi>ſacerdotal function</hi> in the other reſpect. But as to the firſt
'twas or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, <hi>that the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they, i. e. the people, ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth,</hi> Mal. 2.7. And as to the ſecond, <hi>that no ſtranger that is not of the houſe of</hi> Aaron <hi>come neer to offer incenſe before the Lord, that he be not as</hi> Corah <hi>and his company,</hi> Numb. 16.40.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But becauſe there is nothing amongſt men ſo well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but through the Devils ſuggeſtion, and mans corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis liable to <hi>depravation</hi> and <hi>abuſe:</hi> God was pleaſed the better to reſtrain both his Prieſts and people from the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his written Law, to ſtir up in every age ſome choice and ſelect perſons whom he enabled more <hi>immediately,</hi> and
<hi>extraordinarily,</hi> ſome to underſtand, and clear the Truth, and true meaning of his divine Law, when 'twas corrupted, or obſcur'd by miſ-interpretations, and falſe gloſſes: others to foretell, and pronounce both judgements to come upon the tranſgreſſors, and mercies upon ſuch as obſerv'd and kept his commandements: whoſe inſpired writings, both by way of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Propheſie, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Example, Praying,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> are as ſo many commentaries of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> and compleat the Canon of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't by our Lord himſelf to theſe two general heads, <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 22.40.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AS God is the fountain of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is derived unto us by <hi>revelation</hi> from him: ſo the <hi>Devil</hi> is the father of <hi>Falſhood</hi> and lies, which deduce their original from his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſubtil <hi>inſpirations.</hi> And herein the Devil is Gods
<hi>Ape.</hi> cunningly following the ſame waies of <hi>ſeduction,</hi> and
<hi>deceit,</hi> obſerved by God for the conveyance of his <hi>ſaving Truth.</hi> So that where God has his <hi>Church,</hi> the Devil hath his
<hi>Chappel,</hi> and where God has his <hi>true Prophets,</hi> the Devil hath his <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> alſo. And the ſeveral waies of <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115683:67"/>obſerved by the one, are imitated by the other, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Dreams,</hi> and <hi>Viſions, Extaſies,</hi> and <hi>Entrancings. I will go forth and I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouthes of his Prophets,</hi> 1 King. 22.22. Thus the <hi>heavenly Doctrine and miracles of Chriſt are confronted by the devilliſh doctrines and lying wonders of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.9. And a <hi>departure from the true ſaith,</hi> there ever was and ever will be in the Church, whileſt militant here upon earth, <hi>even by giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of Devils,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor does this evil ſpirit work his deceits, and inſpire his damnable doctrines, but by Gods permiſſion, 1. King. 22.22. and therefore the evil ſpirit is ſaid to be <hi>from the Lord.</hi> Becauſe, 1. He is licenc'd by the Lord. And becauſe, 2. His actings upon, and by his ſeduced inſtruments, are like the actings of the Spirit of the Lord upon his ſervants: ſo we read, 1 Sam. 18.10. <hi>An evill ſpirit from the Lord came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Saul, <hi>and he propheſied, i. e.</hi> was entranced, and demean'd himſelf as did the Prophets of the Lord, when extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily mov'd with the Spirit of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe therefore ſome perſons amongſt us, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> have their trances and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>extaſies</hi> alſo in order hereunto: 'twill be pertinent here to add ſome notes of difference betwixt the <hi>extraordinary</hi> actings of the good <hi>Spirit,</hi> and thoſe <hi>agitations,</hi> and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>motions</hi> of the evill <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that the one may be the better diſtinguiſht from the other. But firſt 'twill be neceſſary to underſtand what an Extaſie is, and the kindes thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And rightly to underſtand the nature of an Extaſie, we muſt remember, that man is of a middle nature betwixt <hi>Angels</hi> and
<hi>Beaſts,</hi> and this in reſpect of the two parts or regions of his ſoul, the <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>inferior.</hi> The firſt is cal'd the
<hi>reaſonable,</hi> and the ſecond the <hi>ſenſitive ſoul.</hi> The firſt, man hath in common with the <hi>Angels</hi> of heaven, and the ſecond with the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the earth: now theſe two being combined into one ſoul, there followes hereupon ſuch a combination betwixt the faculties of each, that the working of the one without the other is
<hi>preternatural,</hi> and cal'd an <hi>Extaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115683:67"/>4. So that from hence doth neceſſarily flow two general kindes of <hi>Extaſies:</hi> the one of the
<hi>Reaſonable ſoul,</hi> when that either works, or is wrought upon without the inſtrumental mediation of the ſenſes: being for the time enwrapt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the uſe thereof. And the other of the
<hi>Senſitive ſoul,</hi> when that either acts, or is wrought upon by ſenſible objects, without the guidance, or direction of reaſon. The firſt <hi>Extaſie</hi> is above us, as we are men, for it renders us like to the <hi>Angels</hi> of heaven, which act not by any <hi>organs of ſenſe.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Extaſie</hi> is below us, as we are reaſonable men, for it renders us like unto the <hi>beaſts that periſh.</hi> And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that either of theſe Extaſies be, the harder it is for the ſoul to return to her ſelf, or produce contrary operations to the <hi>Extaſie</hi> wherein ſhe is. Hence ſome holy, and Angelical ſouls, have been ſo enwrapt with divine and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, that their outward ſenſes have been for the time uſeleſs unto them, whileſt they have not minded any earthly thing. And on the other ſide, ſome ſenſual and carnal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (which is the far greater number) are ſo taken up, and pleas'd with their ſenſual and worldly luſts, as if they had not an immortal ſoul to be cared for, nor were endued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be the guide of their actions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But withal we muſt know, that all the former kindes, or all the <hi>Extaſies</hi> of the Reaſonable ſoul, are not holy, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Angelical: but ſome are <hi>natural,</hi> and ſome
<hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the ordinary waies of Divine Revelation before Chriſt.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE <hi>ordinary</hi> means, whereby God
<hi>revealed</hi> and made known his will unto his people, were in the firſter ages, the <hi>Tradition</hi> or delivery of divine Truths from Patriarch to Patriarch, together with the <hi>Catechetical inſtructions</hi> of the firſt born, and heads of families, in whom the ſeveral offices of
<hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> were <hi>pro tempore</hi> enſtated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe divine truths, were not at the firſt committed to writing, becauſe the years of the firſt Patriarchs were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Hook. eccl. pol. l. 1. ſer. 13.</note> that their memories might well ſerve them in ſtead of books: the imperfections and defects whereof God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relieved, by often putting them in minde, of what was moſt neceſſary to be remembred by them. In which reſpect it is eaſie to obſerve, how many times one thing hath been iterated, even to ſundry of the beſt, and wiſeſt amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And thus it continued in the Church of God: which was governed and inſtructed by a traditionary, and unwritten Law from <hi>Adam</hi> to
<hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:115683:70"/>2. When the lives of men upon earth were ſhortned. The written Law of God, as a ſurer and more durable means of
<hi>divine Revelation,</hi> was commanded to be the Rule of their actions. But yet not ſo, as that 'twas permitted to each man to give his own ſenſe, and make his own interpretation of this divine Law at will and pleaſure; but
'twas to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them by the conſecrated Prieſts, and lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prophets of God in all ages, Neh. 8.4,5, &amp;c. Mal. 1.7. Luk. 4.17. Act. 8.30.37.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this way of <hi>revealing</hi> the will of God in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his holy Lawes did differ much in the time of the firſt, and of the ſecond Temple. For under the ſecond Temple Propheſie by
<hi>extraordinary Revelation</hi> generally ceaſed, and hereupon came in a multitude of other Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, Wiſemen,</hi> and <hi>Diſputers,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20. to all whom the people were commanded to give ear, and to <hi>ſeek the Law at their mouth,</hi> Mat.

<hi>Iſaac,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. FOR the better enfitting of perſons both in an

                  <p>And although it be not poſitively in holy writ affirmed, that in ſuch or ſuch a place, there was a Colledge or School, where the gift of Propheſie was ſtudied for (which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the preſent pretenders to <hi>immediate Revelation</hi>) yet is it clearly enough implied in many places, and by the currant of all interpreters of holy Scriptures, by many Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rographers, and other learned perſons, who have deſcribed unto us the cuſtoms and manners of the Hebrewes, and this from the Hebrew Doctors themſelves, who beſt knew the ſtate of their own Common-wealth, 'tis ſufficiently, and fully evidenced unto us.</p>
                  <p>To inſtance in ſome places, and paſſages of holy Scripture, from whence both the being, and ſome orders alſo of theſe Colledges are obſerved.</p>
                  <p>We read Joſh. 15.15. of the city of <hi>Kiriath-ſepher,</hi> which being interpreted is <hi>civitas literarum, the City of Learning:</hi> for here ſaith <hi>Adrichomius</hi> there was an Academy.</p>

                  <p>But then in the ſecond place as to the affirmative, theſe commands of Chriſt are tranſgreſſed three waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When out of pride and ambition, the place and title of
<hi>Maſter,</hi> or Teacher is affected: <hi>They love,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>to be called of men Rabbi:</hi> where not the <hi>title,</hi> but the
<hi>love,</hi> or ambitious affectation of it is reprov'd: to affect the name
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115683:73"/>more then the thing; the place, more then the charge; the
<hi>title,</hi> more then the duty of a <hi>Maſter</hi> or Teacher: is one way, whereby all theſe divine prohibitions are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To give up our faith, and obedience to the ſole will, and command of any <hi>Rabbi</hi> or humane <hi>Doctor</hi> whatſoever, any further then the <hi>word</hi> and doctrine of God the Father doth warrant, and direct us, is a breach of this particular prohibition: <hi>Call no man Father upon earth, for one is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now that the Meſſias was exhibited, to look upon any other ſave Chriſt alone, as the great Prophet of the Lord and
<hi>Doctor</hi> of his Church, is a tranſgreſſion of both theſe particular commands: <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt. Neither be ye called Maſter, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> All <hi>Maſters</hi> of Scholars, were now become
<hi>learners</hi> of Chriſt; And the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves to whom theſe commands were directed, though under Chriſt they were the greateſt
<hi>Maſters</hi> or Teachers of all the world, nevertheleſſe were the

                  <p n="1">1. WHen amongſt the Jewes, their latter Prophets

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All the Law, and the Prophets propheſied untill</hi> John, Mat. 11.13. <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Law,</hi> and the
<hi>Prophets</hi> ſpake of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>come.</hi> The

1.15. and <hi>behold the Lamb of God,</hi> verſ. 29. The <hi>types</hi> and figurative <hi>ſervices</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> were as ſo many <hi>dumb ſhews,</hi> and the <hi>predictions</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> as ſo many <hi>inarticulate ſounds</hi> of the <hi>word Chriſt.</hi> But
<hi>John</hi> was <hi>vox verbi</hi> the very voice of the Word: that's his ſtyle, Mat. 3.3. <hi>The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs.</hi> The
<hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> were as <hi>dim glimmering tapers;</hi> but <hi>John was a burning, and a ſhining light,</hi> Joh. 5.35. And this becauſe he was neareſt unto <hi>Chriſt the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and fountain of all divine illuminations, from whom all the Prophets derive their light, as the Moon and the Stars do from the body of the Sun, which is the fountain of light material.</p>

<hi>Prophets</hi> gave way unto Chriſt, when he who is <hi>the Light of the world</hi> appeared: we read therefore that in the transfiguration of Chriſt upon the mount, <hi>Moſes and Elias appeared to him,</hi> Mat. 17.3.
<hi>Moſes</hi> for the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> for the

<hi>perfected</hi> rather: <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10.4. but 'tis <hi>finis proficiens, non interficiens,</hi> ſaith the Father, not the end to aboliſh, but to finiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Law, &amp; ſic perficiendo confirmare,</hi>

<hi>The day of the Lord came,</hi> and the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi> appeared upon the earth. So that as time grew up, ſo did the

<hi>unuſual:</hi> For <hi>uſually</hi> all the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the Lord both <hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> were bred up in the

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Eliſha,</hi> though he was at the firſt called from the plough, yet was he ſo inſtructed by the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and upon his prayers ſo <hi>extraordinarily</hi> endued with the ſpiritual

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Amos</hi> indeed profeſſeth of himſelf, Amos
7.14. <hi>I was no Prophet, neither was I Prophets ſon, but I was an Herdman and gatherer of Sycomore fruits, and the Lord ſaid uuto me, Go, and propheſie to this people:</hi> But then this is noted withall as a thing

<hi>Prophet,</hi> who was not the <hi>Son of a prophet,</hi> nor bred up in their <hi>Schools,</hi> whereby he might be enfitted for ſo great a

<hi>divine.</hi> And although no <hi>miracle</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for the confirmation of this Prophets <hi>extraordinary</hi> calling; yet of
<hi>Eliſha</hi> who was called from the <hi>plough,</hi> we read, <hi>that he made Iron to ſwim, raiſed the dead, revealed the ſecret counſels of the King of Syria,</hi> being many miles diſtant. And of the Apoſtles, that
<hi>they ſpake diverſe languages, healed all diſeaſes, &amp;c.</hi> If therefore any of theſe perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> and conſequently to be <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> called to preach the Goſpel, can confirm the ſame by any ſuch miracle, 'twould be a very great ſin againſt the good Spirit of God, to deny <hi>that he were in them of a truth:</hi>

                  <p>And undoubtedly it had been a very unfitting thing, that the

                  <p n="1">I. TO the right underſtanding of the true and genuine ſenſe of Gods holy Word, firſt, <hi>The knowledge of Tongues and Languages is requiſite.</hi> For <hi>tongues</hi> are the <hi>gates</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or <hi>the doors</hi> to the houſe of wiſdome: and as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily no man enters a houſe but by the doors thereof; ſo no man, how piercing ſoever his underſtanding be, can enter the cabinet of divine myſteries contained in holy Scriptures, but by ſome inſight in thoſe languages wherein they were<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115683:84"/>written. For 1. 'tis not enough to ſee theſe waters of life in their ſtreams, except we ſee them alſo in their fountain, not only as they are ſeverally and variouſly tranſlated by men, but as they are the immediate dictates of the Spirit of God: for as waters are more clear in the fountain then in the ſtream, ſo the holy Scriptures appear more clear and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible in the
<hi>Original</hi> and fountain Language, then as they are conveighed unto us in the ſtream of Tranſlations into other languages.</p>
                  <p>2. The holy Scripture is full of Metaphors,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. There is no <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> how accurate ſoever, can in all words and phraſes punctually agree with the <hi>Original:</hi> becauſe there are but few words to be found in any language which have not divers ſignifications.</p>

                  <p>In a word, in the interpretation of Scriptures and for the confirmation of holy truths thence deduced, the authority of the ancient
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church is to be conſulted and known for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are certain and undeniable witneſſes of what the Church, and the people of Chriſt did in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective times, believe and hold for orthodox Doctrine. If <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115683:87"/>the ſame doctrine St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> taught in <hi>Africk,</hi> was alſo taught by St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> by St.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in
<hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and ſo in other places by holy and reverend Biſhops, and Paſtors of the Church, then this undoubtedly was the doctrine of the Church: and thus were the holy Scriptures underſtood in thoſe ages of the Church, <hi>Ita intellexit Ambroſius, ita Cyprianus,</hi> &amp;c. Thus
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> underſtood, ſuch or ſuch a place of Scripture, this had ſome weight in St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> time, and St. <hi>Aug.</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and there is no reaſon, but that it ſhould be of the ſame force ſtill amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no way probable but that perſons ſo eminent in

                  <p n="3">3. The judgement of the Fathers being ſo far remote from theſe times wherein we live, muſt needs be impartial as to the controverſies amongſt us, touching the interpretation of any texts of Scripture, or doctrines therein delivered, as being altogether diſintereſted, and knowing nothing of our diſputes and conteſtations thereabouts, <hi>Nullas nobiſcum vel vobiſcum amicitias attenderunt, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We cannot but reaſonably imagine, that thoſe holy and learned perſons, who lived nearer the Apoſtles times, ſhould proportionably know better the Apoſtles meaning in their writings, and the doctrine they preached, then any of us who live ſo many hundred years ſince.

                  <p n="1">1. TIs confeſſed, that all the <hi>external</hi> parts of humane learning already remembred, though they be the <hi>gifts,</hi> and bleſſings of Gods Spirit, and neceſſary helps to the opening of the Letter, and right underſtanding of the literal and genuine ſenſe of Gods word, yet are not in themſelves alone ſufficient to attain a true, and throughly ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof: except our ſouls be enricht as with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>gifts,</hi> ſo with inward <hi>graces</hi> of the holy Spirit alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> are the two inſeparable conſtituent parts of ſpiritual wiſdome: and to underſtand the
<hi>truth</hi> or true meaning of the Spirit of Truth in the word, the Spirit of <hi>holineſs</hi> muſt neceſſarily concur. And this is moſt eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed <hi>Job</hi> 28. where after a moſt high, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent expreſſion of the praiſes, great price and value of true wiſdome, a view is taken of all the parts of the world, where it might be found: gold and ſilver, iron and braſſe, all uſeful metals, and precious ſtones, have their places, though ſecret, deſigned them: but where ſhall this rich pearl,<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115683:90"/>
                     <hi>where ſhall wiſdome be found, and what is the place of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings?</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>It is not found in the land of the living: the depth ſaith, It is not in me, and the ſea ſaith, It is not in me.</hi> Verſ. 14. <hi>It is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept cloſe from the fowls of the air,</hi> verſ.
21. The moſt Eagly ſighted Philoſophers, and wiſemen of the world, who have viewed the natures, properties, and cauſes of all things, not in the earth alone, but in the heavens alſo, even the courſes, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and operations of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, have not yet attained true wiſdome: how then ſhall we finde it out? it followes, <hi>God knoweth the place thereof, and he underſtandeth the way thereof,</hi> verſ. 23.—<hi>And he hath ſaid, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdome, and to depart from evil is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> briefly deſcribing both the place of wiſdome, and the way thereunto; even the way of <hi>piety,</hi> and
<hi>obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of that <hi>piety,</hi> which is neceſſarily requiſite to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of holy Truth, there are ſeveral ſpecies or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts, which from the example of holy <hi>Bernard,</hi> may be thus reckoned up: <hi>Qui ut legeret, intelligendi fecit cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas; ut intelligeret, oratio impetravit; ut impetraret, quid niſi vitae ſanctitas promeruit?</hi> His earneſt deſire of knowledge, made him ſtudious and induſtrious in reading: his fervent prayers obtained the underſtanding of what he read: and his holy life made his prayers effectual for the enlightning of his underſtanding: and thus he muſt deſire, thus ſtudy, thus pray, and thus live, who will attain that knowledge, which ſhall make him wiſe to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt divine qualification of the ſoul requiſite unto knowledge is the <hi>deſire</hi> thereof: <hi>The beginning of wiſdome is the deſire of inſtruction,</hi> Wiſd. 6.17. <hi>Come unto me all ye that be deſirous of me, and fill your ſelves with my fruits,</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 24.19. and what is more authentick: <hi>If thou ſeekeſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſure, then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and finde the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> Prov. 2.4. Such deſires, and ſtudies for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the holy Ghoſt undoubtedly would never 1. exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie, 2. exhort unto, 3. enkindle in the hearts of men, but that they ſhould tend not to vexation, and trouble, but to<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115683:91"/>ſatisfaction and accompliſhment in the proſecution of them: <hi>Et hoc modo priùs invenire oportet ut quaeras, deinde quaerere ut pleniùs invenias.</hi>

                  <p>HEe that pretends unto or depends upon any further
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> from heaven then God in his great mercy hath already afforded unto his Church and people, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>His written Word,</hi> 2. <hi>Thoſe ſeveral means and helps forementioned,</hi> both
<hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane, outward</hi> and <hi>inward,</hi> for the right underſtanding of his Word, by the bleſſing of God, and the ſecret influence of his holy Spirit upon our ſtudies, and meditations therein: laies himſelf open to manifold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and dangerous ſeductions of the ſpirit of error and deluſion: and as much as in him lies, ſubverts the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the holy Chriſtian Faith: for hereupon theſe
<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive inconveniencies</hi> muſt needs enſue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The canon of holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is tranſgreſt and diſſolv'd, by the ſuperaddition of <hi>new Revelations:</hi> and the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods Word is made null, and void; that muſt paſſe for a
<hi>dead letter,</hi> when the fictitions dreams, and deluſions of every idle enthuſiaſtical brain, under the mask of <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſhall be miſtaken and miſcalled too, <hi>The quickning Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he that ſets up any thing of Religion to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Optal. 1.3.</note> 1. ſaith the Father, he doth, <hi>aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium de ruina conſtruere,</hi> erect a building upon the ruines of Gods truth; and ſuch a building can be no better but an heap of errors and deceits: For what will not he dare to affirm, and hold, who holds any thing <hi>beſides,</hi> or <hi>above,</hi> or but <hi>equal</hi> to the Word of God, for the Rule of Faith? Hereupon the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> hath been denied, and <hi>the laſt judgement,</hi> 
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:115683:94"/>and the neceſſity of all <hi>holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> works, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequences of theſe points of our faith: for he that believes not the Reſurrection, and laſt judgement, <hi>Quid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni aut veri,</hi> what <hi>holy Truth</hi> will he care to believe, or what <hi>good action</hi> will he make conſcience to practiſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He oppoſes himſelf to the doctrine of the
<hi>univerſal Church</hi> of Chriſt, for 1600 years together, who with one unanimous, and common conſent, have received the holy Scriptures as the very canon of Faith, without addition or diminution, without ever hoping or waiting for any <hi>new Revelations</hi> to be ſuperadded thereunto: and very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſure, if that diſmal curſe wherewith the canon of holy Scripture is concluded, have any influence upon the mindes of men, Rev.
22.18.19. <hi>If any man adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde unto him, the plagues that are written in this book, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And more particularly he makes void all thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> to <hi>hear, read, meditate,</hi> and <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> our ſelves in the Lawes of God: For all <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> of Gods will, preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the knowledge of the truth, without any <hi>ſearch, ſtudy,</hi> &amp;c. The contempt or neglect of which duty hath ſad and heavie judgements threatned thereunto, as Jer. 9.13, &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord ſaith, Becauſe they have forſaken my Law, which I ſet before them—And have walked after the imagination of their own heart—I will feed them with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink, I will ſcatter them among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> &amp;c. with manifold texts to the ſame purpoſe, both in the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Teſtament, as Prov. 13.13. &amp; 28.9. Pſal. 81.11,12. Zach. 7.12.13. Joh. 5.45,46. &amp;
12.48.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He makes void and unneceſſary the ſacred function of the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> or Miniſtery, which God hath in all ages or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and ſetled in his Church, as to mediate with God for the people, ſo to inſtruct the people from God: And this ſacred office God hath both confirmed by miracles, and by teſtimony of his bleſſings ordinary and extraordinary, and guarded the ſame by many direful threatnings denounced, and many heavie judgements inflicted upon ſuch as have, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115683:95"/>ſhal ſacrilegiouſly violate, infringe, or uſurp this office, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, refuſe, or contemn to hear the word of God in the mouthes of his Prophets, and faithful Miniſters: See amongſt many other places, Jer. 5.12, &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe the people belied the Lord, and ſaid, It is not he,</hi> when he ſpake by his Prophet; And becauſe they ſaid moreover, <hi>The Prophets ſhall become winde, and the word is not in them—Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe ye ſpeak this word, I will make my words in thy mouth, fire, and this people wood, and it ſhall devour them:</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, Jer. 6.10,11,12. &amp; Mat.
10.14,15. Luk. 10.11,12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All pretence to <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> lords it over the faith of our Chriſtian brethren: For an <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> commands an <hi>immediate belief,</hi> and blinde obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further ſearch or trial at all: contrary to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commands, 1 Joh 4.1. <hi>Beleeve not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits:</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> or agreeable to the word of God: but reject that which is not ſo, and hold for accurſed the publiſhers, and promoters thereof: Gal.
1.8. <hi>Though we, or an Angel from heaven ſhould preach unto you another Goſpel beſides what ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>faith of the Enthuſiaſt</hi> (if it may be called a faith, and not rather an illuſion of his fancy) is not built upon the ſame grounds with <hi>the faith of Chriſts Church;</hi> which is the
<hi>pillar and ground of truth:</hi> the Church is built upon <hi>the foundation of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the head corner ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.20. <hi>i. e.</hi> what the
<hi>Prophets</hi> of the Old Teſtament, and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of the New, have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> to be the doctrine of ſalvation in Chriſt, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which the faith of all true Chriſtians is built upon: But the
<hi>Enthuſiaſts faith,</hi> is not built upon <hi>old,</hi> but upon
<hi>new Revelations,</hi> not upon what is <hi>revealed</hi> already through the mediation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and communicated by their ſucceſſors, but upon what ſhall be <hi>immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> from heaven: and this <hi>groundleſs ground</hi> of faith is oppoſed to that which is the <hi>true ground</hi> of faith indeed, and made of equal authority therewith; ſo that upon this ground<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115683:95"/>every private mans ſayings, and affirmations are of as great authority, and as much to be regarded, as the divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſayings of the Prophets and Apoſtles; and this muſt needs be ſo, were there any truth in mens pretended
<hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi> for undoubtedly we owe as much <hi>faith, reverence,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to every <hi>Revelation</hi> from heaven, how mean ſoever the perſon be, that receives it, as we do to any part of Gods Word already <hi>revealed,</hi> though by the greateſt
<hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> that ever lived upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All dependence upon <hi>new Revelations,</hi> laies a ſecret ſtain of diſhonour upon God: and this in two reſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. That God, notwithſtanding his ſeveral methods of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Revelation,</hi> by the Patriarchs and Prophets of old, by his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in theſe laſt daies, ſhould yet be defective in making known to his people the waies of his ſervice, and of their own ſalvation.</item>
                        <item> 2. All pretence to new lights and <hi>Revelations,</hi> makes God, <hi>the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſſe, or ſhadow of change,</hi> to vary and change his minde as oft as the fickle and deceitful mindes of men do alter: Nay, thus God is made to ſpeak things quite oppoſite and contrary to himſelf; whileſt the ſeveral conceits, ſecret ſuggeſtions, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mens hearts, which are as numerous as the ſand, and contrarious as light, and darkneſs, are yet all under pretence of <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> fixed upon God, who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It doth extremely much derogate, and detract from the honour of holy Chriſtian Religion to have no better ground and foundation, then either the divinity of the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old, or that of the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> which of later times hath ſo far overſpread, and ſwallowed up ſo many Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and flouriſhing Common-wealths in the world; and both the one and the other of theſe, not only derive their <hi>original,</hi> but alſo their <hi>progreſſe, ſucceſſe,</hi> and preſent <hi>continuance</hi> doth depend upon
<hi>immediate Revelations:</hi> which no good Chriſtian ſurely doth doubt to be any other then <hi>Diabolical Deluſions:</hi> The Divinity of the
<hi>Heathens</hi> was ſuch, as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of their reſpective
<hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> delivered<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115683:96"/>to the people in their prophetick trances, for celeſtial <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes,</hi> and divine <hi>inſpirations:</hi> And the more ſubtil, and ſublime of the heathen Philoſophers recommend unto us, an <hi>Ecſtatical</hi> contemplation, even to the abolition of the underſtanding, and Reaſon, as the higheſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way of divine knowledge. <hi>Mahomet</hi> began with <hi>Raptures,</hi> and <hi>extaſies,</hi> and ſuppoſed
<hi>Revelations</hi> of Angels. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider the monſtrous <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the one, and the horrid
<hi>Blaſphemies</hi> of the other, will be careful ſurely how he truſts unto, or depends upon <hi>immediate Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. This doctrine of <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> (ſhould it be granted) is not ſafe for ſober and peaceable-minded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to embrace, or depend upon it: but is fitteſt rather for ſuch perſons, whoſe deſtructive plots, and deſigns, under the mask of Religion, are to dethrone, and murder Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, ruine well eſtabliſht government, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, both Eccleſiaſtick and Civil, maſſacre their Chriſtian brethren, rob, ruine, and deſtroy whatever oppoſes their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and private perſwaſions in point of faith, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how ſacred and uſeful ſoever it be: ſuch miſchiefs and barbarous cruelties, when open force is wanting to effect, may be, and too often have been effected by <hi>pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> and men of
<hi>ecſtatical,</hi> and ſeduced fancies; who have thought they have greatly merited thereby, and done God good ſervice by deſtroying the enemies of his Truth, and aboliſhing <hi>Haereſie, Superſtition,</hi> &amp;c. when as indeed they have made havock of a people more righteous then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deſtroy'd the truth, and true worſhip of God, open'd the way to diſorder and confuſion, and this through <hi>perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſacriledge, murder, rebellion,</hi> and the breach of all the lawes of <hi>piety, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The neglect of the means of ſaving knowledge,
<hi>viz. learning,</hi> divine and humane, and to depend upon
<hi>Revelation,</hi> without the uſe of ſuch means, is the way to advance Lady <hi>Ignorance</hi> again as the mother of devotion,<note place="margin">Eſpencaeus.</note> to drown the world in Barbariſm, &amp; to reduce the Church of Chriſt to that ſad condition, wherin it was in the ninth age, which was called,<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115683:96"/>
                     <hi>The unlearned, and the unhappy age of the Church:</hi> wherein he that ſtudied Philoſophy, and the Mathematicks was counted a Magician: he that knew the Greek tongue was ſhrewdly ſuſpected, but if he underſtood Hebrew alſo, he was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then an Haeretique. 'Tis obſerved by the learned, both
<hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> that all the ten bloudy perſecutions of the Church by the Heathen Emperors, did not ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage holy Chriſtian Religion, as did the ſubtil underminings of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate,<note place="margin">Euſeb. eccl. hiſt. l. 10. c. 32.

<hi>faggot;</hi> but by taking from them all offices of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and places of preferment: all Eccleſiaſtical promotions, and Church priviledges, and more eſpecially by putting down, and forbidding all Schools of learning, for the training up their youth in the knowledge of tongues and ſciences: that ſo the <hi>light</hi> of holy Religion might be loſt in the <hi>dark</hi> of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and decay of arts: For Arts and Tongues are the handmaids to holy Religion: theſe as 'twere hold the candle, whileſt the ſacred light of Truth is diſplay'd for our direction in the waies of light and life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He <hi>tempts</hi> the good Spirit of God, who expects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the knowledge of Truth by <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> and miracle, which by <hi>ordinary,</hi> common,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dominum ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, eſt novo miraculo velle perficere, quod aliis rationibus fieri poteſt.</hi>
                     </note> and known means is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable: ſo the Devil tempted our Lord to feed himſelf with the bread of a miracle, when Gods ordinary and common providence yeelded bread enough, Mat. 4.3. and to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down from the pinnacle of the Temple, when the way to come down by ſteps, was plain and eaſie without any ſuch praecipitation.</p>
                  <p>That dependence upon <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> is
<hi>unneceſſary,</hi> and conſequently <hi>uſeleſſe</hi> and unprofitable, is manifeſt from what hath been already ſaid from the ſufficiency of Gods revealed Truth: and is yet further manifeſt from the vain, and bootleſſe iſſue of all ſuch dependence; For what ſacred Myſteries of holy Religion have been either made known, or more plainly unfolded by <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> in theſe laſt daies ſince the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? many <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:115683:97"/>and lies, many <hi>Haereſies</hi> and errors, many
<hi>Schiſmes</hi> and diviſions, have fancied <hi>Revelations</hi> brought forth: but that any ſound ſoul-ſaving truth hath been of later times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately revealed, I could yet never hear or read of by any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick witneſſes: and it is moſt juſt with God to give men up to the vanity of their minde, and to the deluſions of their own hearts, who thus
<hi>tempt</hi> his holy Spirit, by leaving the known and beaten paths of Truth
<hi>revealed,</hi> to depend upon what is <hi>unneceſſary, uſeleſs,</hi> and <hi>vain:</hi> and not only ſo, but alſo,</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Dependence upon <hi>immediate Revelations</hi> laies us open to the deluſions of Satan,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> who
<hi>transforming himſelf into an angel of light,</hi> inſinuates his ſuggeſtions, and diabolical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines under the ſhew and vizard of divine Revelations: Many pious men have been deluded by this wile of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,<note place="margin">Tert. de anima c. 9.</note> and have faln into groſſe errors. <hi>Tertullian</hi> though he obſerved this, and ſaw how groſly many of <hi>Montanus</hi> ſect were cheated into foul miſtakes and errors, upon fancied <hi>Revelations,</hi> yet notwithſtanding ſo ſtrongly doth the Devil work upon the fancy by the force of this inchantment, that he himſelf was deceived alſo, and became a <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> being couſened hereunto, eſpecially by the pretended <hi>Revelations</hi> of a holy ſiſter, whom he much extols in his tract <hi>de Animâ:</hi> whoſe pretended viſion of the ſubſtance of a ſoul <hi>corporally</hi> exhibited to her view, made him believe the ſoul to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal: and although for this opinion he was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for haereſie; neither yet was guilty of thoſe more groſs and blaſphemous opinions of the

                  <p>Thoſe two great pretenders to <hi>Revelation, Priſca</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla, Montanus</hi> his minions, were ſo long couſened with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical <hi>illuſions,</hi> which they took for divine
<hi>Revelations,</hi> that at the laſt it was <hi>revealed</hi> unto them, that they ſhould hang themſelves, that they might paſſe from the miſeries of this life, to the joyes of the other:<note place="margin">Euſeb. eccl. hiſt. lib. 5. c. 16.</note> And <hi>Theodotus</hi> a Montaniſt had a viſion, that he ſhould be taken up into heaven, and beleeving the ſpirit of error, he was lifted up on high, and thence let fall down to the earth again, and ſo miſerably ended his life: And many of <hi>Montanus</hi> ſect which were great pretenders to <hi>Revelation,</hi> and had withdrawn themſelves from communion with the Catholick Church, at ſeveral times ended their lives in an <hi>halter,</hi> being thereinto incited by the Devil that inſpired them, who was the father of their <hi>Revelations.</hi>

                  <p>There were another ancient ſort of Haereticks in the Church, cal'd <hi>Meſſalians,</hi> and from their aſſiduity in prayers more then ordinary, they were alſo called <hi>Euchites:</hi> Their tenents were,
<hi>that every one brought into the world with him an evil ſpirit, wherewith they were poſſeſt until by earneſt prayer the evil ſpirit being driven away, the good Spirit of God did take poſſeſſion of their ſouls, and after this they needed no more, no Sacraments, no Sermons, no Scripture to make them perfect, for they could ſee the holy Trinity viſibly, and foretel things to come, and all by immediate Revelation:</hi> But by this pretence to perfection, and dependence upon Revelation, moſt of them, if not all, prov'd to be really poſſeſt by the Devil,<note place="margin">Theod.

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Several texts alledged againſt humane Learning, and againſt the Miniſtery, and for immediate Bevelation, explained.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 31.34. Heb. 8.10,11,12.</note>THE tenor of the new covenant recorded Jer. 31.34. and remembred to be accompliſht, Heb. 8.10,11,12. is the chief place alledged againſt the neceſſity of
<hi>Learning,</hi> or the <hi>teaching</hi> of man, as containing the promiſe of an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teaching</hi> from God himſelf: <hi>This is the covenant which I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord: I will put my Lawes into their minde, and write them in their hearts—And they ſhall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt: for I will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which Text conſiſting of three verſes, there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference betwixt the <hi>old</hi> covenant and the <hi>new,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>old</hi> Law was written in Tables of ſtone, but the <hi>new</hi> in the fleſhly tables of mens hearts: verſ. 10. <hi>I will put my Lawes into their mindes, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> my Lawes under the
<hi>new</hi> covenant ſhall be more agreeable to the <hi>mindes,</hi> and more approve themſelves to the <hi>Spirits</hi> of men to be the waies of perfection and felicity, and conſequently ſhall have a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger influence upon their <hi>hearts,</hi> then the Laws of the <hi>old</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: for that conſiſted of many <hi>beggerly elements</hi> many types and figures, rites and ceremonies, which conſidered in themſelves, had no ſuch efficacy to work upon the ſoul to obey them, as the Lawes of the Goſpel have: therefore the one are call'd <hi>carnal</hi> ordinances, and the other <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was more need of frequent inſtructions, and
<hi>teachings</hi> of the people, to keep them up to the obſervance of thoſe <hi>carnal</hi> ordinances under the <hi>old</hi> Law, then there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115683:99"/>is under the <hi>new:</hi> becauſe the doctrines of the Goſpel are more plain, clear and convincing: ſo that perſons of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt capacity may underſtand the knowledge of God: which is the meaning of verſ. 11. <hi>They ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, &amp;c.</hi> Not that there ſhould be no teaching at all under the Goſpel, but that leſſe teaching ſhould ſerve the turn.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſacrifices under the Law, were weak and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as to the taking away of ſins: but the offering up of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, once for all, is a ſufficient ſacrifice for our ſins, and <hi>not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole world,</hi>
1 Joh. 2.2. and that's the ſcope of verſ. 12. <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſſe: and their ſins and iniquities I will remember no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the further clearing of theſe words,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>They ſhall not teach, &amp;c.</hi> There is a twofold knowledge of God: 1. In this life, 2. In the life to come. And to both of theſe the words in their literal ſenſe do relate.
<list>
                        <item>1. That in this life the knowledge of God under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was not at the firſt taught by man, but by the bleſſed Son of God himſelf, by him the Apoſtles were inſtructed at the firſt, and not one of another: And to him this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is by himſelf applied, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> Joh. 6.45.</item>
                        <item> 2. That in the life to come, all the bleſſed Saints of God from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſhall truly know God without the mediation of <hi>humane Teaching:</hi> For then ſhall we ſee God as he is:
<hi>when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9,10.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that in this life the people ſhall have no need of
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> them the knowledge of God, is a falſe collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the words: For as under the <hi>Law, Moſes</hi> taught Gods will unto the people, and afterwards, they that ſate <hi>in Moſes chair;</hi> ſo under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> 1. Chriſt himſelf
<hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> Gods will to his Church, and afterwards his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors in all ages ſince: this being one of the promiſes and priviledges of the Goſpel, <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers,</hi> Iſa. 30.20. And of the gifts of the Spirit:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115683:99"/>
                     <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 4.11,12. For as the ſame Apoſtle demands, <hi>How ſhall they,</hi> i. e. <hi>any people believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi> Rom. 10.14. where
<hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> are affirmed to be the neceſſary mediums of <hi>receiving the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>believing in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another place to the ſame purpoſe is alledged, 1 Joh. 2.20.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And ye need not, that any man teach you</hi>] So far as they were already taught, and knew all things already that were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known, they had no need of any man to <hi>teach</hi> them: namely, as

<hi>taught,</hi> that they may return to that faith from which they are faln: but theſe faithful perſons to whom the Apoſtle here writes, were it ſeems neither <hi>ignorant,</hi> nor yet <hi>ſeduced;</hi> and in neither of theſe <hi>reſpects</hi> had need of <hi>teaching:</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The like place,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.9.</note> which may help alſo to the further clearing of this, is 1 Theſſ. 4.9.
<hi>Touching brotherly love ye have no need, that I write unto you, for ye your ſelves are taught of God to love one another:</hi> Taught of God, but how? not by <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation,</hi> but by the Goſpel of Chriſt the Son of God, who doth ſo often inculcate this leſſon of brotherly love, Joh.
13.34,35. &amp; 15.17. And the like is to be ſaid of all other Goſpel Truths, all of them we are taught of God: From him they deſcend originally: he is the <hi>fountain</hi> of Truth, and Chriſt is the <hi>Conduit</hi> through whom the <hi>waters of life</hi> do flow: from <hi>God</hi> to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> from Chriſt to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> from them to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Diſciples, Paſtors</hi> and
<hi>people</hi> in all ages.</p>
                  <p>But withal 'tis confeſſed, and with all thankfulneſs of ſoul to be acknowledged, That there is an <hi>inward</hi> teaching of God, as well as an <hi>outward,</hi> viz. the <hi>dictate</hi> of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well as the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the Word without. Theſe two God hath joyned together, and we muſt not preſume to part them, by depending upon the one without the other: for as all ſtudy, and meditation, reading, and hearing the Word, are ineffectual, if the inward influence of Gods Spirit does not open the wndowes of the ſoul to receive the light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played thence: ſo the inward influence and working of Gods Spirit, is ordinarily and for the moſt part ſilent and ſtirreth not but by reading, hearing, meditating of the word, and of good inſtructions thence derived: the one being as the body, and the other the ſoul of Religion: and when theſe two meet together,
<hi>viz.</hi> the unction <hi>without,</hi> and the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>within:</hi> or when the ſpiritual <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi>

Thus it was then, and 'twas then neceſſary, becauſe the firſt publication, and planting of the Goſpel, required <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> and more ample gifts and abilities for the effecting thereof: But we muſt not look to ſee thoſe daies of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115683:101"/>effuſions to return again: which is intimated in that they are called, <hi>the laſt daies,</hi> in the text, as being the <hi>laſt time</hi> we muſt expect any ſuch <hi>miraculous</hi> and

                  <p>From this general deſcription of an <hi>Heretique,</hi> and the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Hereſle, the particular <hi>ingredients,</hi> whereof the cup of Heretical poyſon is compounded, will appear to be theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be an Heretique is to erre in matters of

1. To refuſe to joyn in the participation of the ſame <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
2. In the uſe of the ſame <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or publick forms of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. As to the 1. There is <hi>but one baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4.5. or one Sacrament whereby we are engraffed into the body of Chriſts Church, which whoſoever refuſes, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admits, both the <hi>Catabaptiſt,</hi> and the
<hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> makes a breach in the myſtical body of Chriſt. So,
<hi>but one Sacrament of our nouriſhment and growth in grace,</hi> even that of the holy body and bloud of Chriſt: in communion whereof, <hi>we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16,17. Even ſaith the Father, <hi>As many grains are incorporate in one bread, and many members in one body, ſo the faithful members of Chriſts Church, make up but one bread and body, by participation of Chriſts bleſſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud under the ſacramental repreſentation of bread and wine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note> He that contemns or neglects then the uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, doth for his part

4.15. And Sacraments amongſt many other holy ends of their inſtitution, hath this for one, that they are <hi>marks of diſtinctions,</hi> ſaith judicious <hi>Hooker, to ſeparate Gods own people from ſtrangers.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To decline the uſe, and to refuſe to joyn in the Church <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or publique forms of divine ſervice; ſuch
<hi>Liturgies</hi> being both agreeable to the word of God, and to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and conſtant practiſe of the Church in all ages; if it be not in it ſelf a branch of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> 'tis the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and curſed <hi>parent</hi> thereof: For as no <hi>form</hi> of prayer is the mother of confuſion, ſo <hi>ſeveral forms</hi> by perſons of the ſame Church, are the means and in-lets of diviſion: for whileſt one likes this mans way of praying, and another likes another mans<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115683:119"/>way: one ſaith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another, I am of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore to prevent all diviſion in the Church, and to keep out all <hi>corruptions</hi> both in faith and manners, and to avoid all
<hi>ignorant, inſignificant, improper,</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> waies of expreſſing our mindes, unto God in prayer: As alſo that we might communicate in each others prayers, and reap the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of each others fervency and devotion of ſoul in prayer, theſe were the great and weighty reaſons wherefore ever a ſet and ſtanding form of publique prayers hath been preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and uſed in the Church of Chriſt. And when we do conſider, and remember, 1. That God himſelf under the Law commanded ſet forms of prayer to be uſed, Numb. 6.23. Deut. 20.3. &amp; 26.3,5. 2. That
<hi>Moſes</hi> thankſgiving for that admirable victory given the Iſraelites againſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not only ſtands upon record for a precedent or pattern for the framing of prayers, which might be repeated often; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo grew afterwards to be a part of the Jewiſh Liturgy. 3. That all the Pſalmes are ſo many ſet forms of prayer and praiſe that were uſed in the Temple, 2 Chron. 29.30. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they never had again the ſame occaſions which brought them forth at the firſt. 4. That under the Goſpel, not only <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> firſt, but afterwards Chriſt himſelf taught his Diſciples a ſet form of prayer, with a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand when ever they prayed, to ſay, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Luk.
11.1,2. 5. That Chriſt himſelf uſed a ſet form in his agony, Mat. 26
39. not altering his expreſſions, (as if God were pleaſed with variety of phraſes, a cuſtome which only ſerves to tickle the itching ears of men, and win popular applauſe) <hi>but he went again and prayed, ſaying the ſame words,</hi> verſ. 44. And alſo upon the croſſe he uſed a ſet form, not of his own framing, but uſed long before in the Church, Mat. 27.46.
6. That this was the way of the primitive Church, as appears from the
<hi>Liturgies</hi> of S. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, &amp;c.</hi> And 7. if we conſider with the judicious <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If then the wiſdome of the Church determined, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and ſet forms of prayer were neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the true faith: it muſt needs follow, that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and contempt hereof hath not been the leaſt cauſe of ſo much depravation, and corruption of the faith amongſt us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Schiſms</hi> and breaches of publique communion are thoſe gaps, whereat. <hi>Hereſies</hi> do enter: we muſt need acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if we conſider, That the <hi>Devil</hi> who is the author of all <hi>Schiſm</hi> and diviſion (who is therefore ſo well known to the vulgar by his cloven foot) is <hi>ſerpens lubricus,</hi> a ſly, ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, inſinuating ſerpent, give him but the <hi>inch,</hi> and he will quickly have the ell: ſuffer him but to make a rent in the

And the like is obvious to each mans obſervation amongſt us, how the decent <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and publique orders of Prayer, and of the Sacraments, being ſtruck at, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of both hath not long continued free from that impetuous violence of factious, and ſchiſmatical ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

From the cohaerence of which Text, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of contentiouſneſs is alſo obſervable: For 1. all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was about <hi>ceremonies,</hi> about wearing long or ſhort hair, praying covered, or bare, verſ. 13, 14, 15. &amp; verſ. 4, 5, 6.

<hi>Error</hi> being in it ſelf crooked, and deformed, puts on the ſhape, and ever appears in the likeneſs of holy truth, following her ſteps to trip up her heels, and take poſſeſſion of her throne: The very Philoſophy of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, was followed and undermin'd by falſe Philoſophers: and amongſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> their <hi>circumciſion,</hi> and ſome other rites and ceremonies were imitated by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and other nations: and yet the one were the worſhippers of the true God herein, and the others worſhipped Idols: And in the worſhip of the true God, to that which is ſound and ſincere is oppoſed falſe, counterfeit, and hypocritical worſhip: to the true and lawful <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is oppoſed unlawful and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular <hi>dipping:</hi> to the commandements of God, the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men: to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt,

Damſcene,</hi> who out of Eccleſiaſtical records have given the ſeveral catalogues of Hereſies and Heretiques.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons why God is pleaſed to permit it ſhould be ſo, may be reduc'd to two general heads, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>In reſpect of the faith it ſelf.</hi> 2. <hi>In reſpect of the profeſſors thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the faith of Chriſt,</hi> 1. The excellency thereof doth appear from the manifold aſſaults, and machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115683:129"/>of the devil thereagainſt: for were not the ſtedfaſt profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, and the conſcientious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof, the way both of Gods acceptable ſervice, and of mans ſalvation, the devil would never be ſo buſie to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and adulterate the ſame, whoſe inveterate enmity both to God and man, incites, provokes him perpetually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave and falſifie the <hi>pure worſhip</hi> of the one, and hinder the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of the other.</p>
                  <p>2. The holy <hi>faith</hi> of Chriſt appears more
<hi>pure,</hi> ſincere, and illuſtrious by the teſt, and oppoſition of
<hi>heretical</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: we read Numb. 16.36. that the Lord commanded
<hi>Moſes to take the cenſers of thoſe proud rebels, which roſe up againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>wherein they offered ſtrange fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and to make broad plates for a covering of the Altar; for they offered them before the Lord, therefore are they hallowed: ſc. ſanctificata in mortibus peccatorum:</hi> Through the death of the offenders they were ſanctified to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to the children of Iſrael, to beware of the like ſchiſm, inſurrection, and ſacriledge. <hi>Theſe cenſers,</hi> (ſaith the Father) <hi>are a figure of the holy Scriptures, wherein Heretiques offer ſtrange fire, by impoſing a ſtrange ſenſe, and diſtinct from the minde of Gods Spirit therein,</hi> which is ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God, that 'tis commonly the ruine of the Authors, and abettors thereof: But yet if we bring theſe <hi>brazen cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> to the
<hi>golden Altar</hi> of God, and compare the ſtrange fire therein, with the true fire from heaven, the luſtre of the one will appear more clear and eminent, through the falſe and counterfeit gloſſe of the other: for as that maxime is true in general, <hi>Contraria inter ſe oppoſita magis eluceſcunt,</hi> All contraries by their mutual oppoſition do more clearly ſhew themſelves, ſo this in particular alſo is as true, <hi>veritas falſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum comparatione magis fulgebit,</hi> Truth when compared and oppoſed to falſhood, appears like gold from the droſs when tryed in the fire, more illuſtrious and ſhining.</p>
                  <p>'Tis one reaſon therefore, why holy catholick doctrine is ſo much beſieged, and impugned by heretical gainſayers, and <hi>tares</hi> of erroneous opinions are intermixt with the <hi>pure grain</hi> of ſincerity and truth, <hi>viz. That the holy faith might <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115683:130"/>not looſe its gloſs and luſtre, but appearing like it ſelf clear and perſpicuous might more effectually conduce to the illumination of our ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The holy <hi>faith</hi> by the oppoſition of
<hi>Hereſie</hi> is <hi>elevated</hi> and raiſed to a higher pitch of perfection, and the myſteries thereof become thereby to be more acutely handled, more narrowly ſifted, and throughly conſidered: whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe like children we ſhould ever be content with <hi>milk,</hi> and neglect the more ſolid and <hi>ſubſtantial food,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Haereticos per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit Deus, ne ſemper lacte nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triamur, &amp; in bruta infantia remaneamus.</hi> Aug. Tract. 36. in Joh.</note> reſting in <hi>generals,</hi> and not deſcending to the diſcuſſion and right underſtanding of <hi>particular</hi> truths. So ſaith the Father,
<hi>God therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Heretiques amongſt us, that we might not alway be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with milk, and continue for ever in the more brutiſh eſtate of infancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The holy <hi>faith</hi> by the oppoſition of
<hi>Hereſie</hi> is the more <hi>confirmed</hi> and ſtrengthned, even as trees ſhaken with the winde, take the faſter hold, and are thereby more firmly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted in the earth; ſo the more the foundation of our faith is aſſaulted and ſhaken by the guſts of heretical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the faſter hold is taken, and more firmly the principles of holy truth are enrooted in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this the weakeſt argument to perſwade us of, and confirm us in the truth of all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith, that notwithſtanding the ſeveral oppoſitions of <hi>Hereſies</hi> in all ages, many whereof have for the time ſo proſpered and prevailed, as to infect the greater and more eminent ſort of Chriſtian profeſſors, yet the true faith hath ever in the end triumphed over them; they have daſht themſelves in pieces like waves againſt a rock have broken into a foam, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in to ſmoke: for, <hi>magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit: As for truth it endureth, and is alwaies ſtrong, it liveth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth for evermore,</hi> Eſd. 4.38.</p>
                  <p n="2">The ſecond general <hi>end</hi> why God permits
<hi>Hereſies,</hi> is in reſpect of <hi>the profeſſors</hi> of the holy faith: And theſe being of two ſorts, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> either ſuch as are ſound <hi>grain,</hi> or elſe ſuch as are empty
<hi>chaffe,</hi> therefore he ſuffers the <hi>fan</hi> of temptation to paſſe over all, by the aſſaults of erroneous<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115683:130"/>opinions, that the one might be diſtinguiſht from the other, that the corn might be <hi>winnowed</hi> from the chaffe, the wheat ſeparate from the tares, and ſoundorthodox Chriſtians might be known from the unſound, hollow-hearted,<note place="margin">Chryſ. Hom. 19. in Mat. 7.</note> hypocritical profeſſors of the faith. <hi>That the evil may not be crowned with the good, therefore God ſends temptations</hi> (ſaith the Father)
<hi>and that the good may not periſh with the evil, therefore he commands us to beware of falſe Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The reaſon why the unſound, and <hi>ſinful profeſſors,</hi> are tempted, and by temptation overcome by the aſſaults of erroneous opinions in Religion, is by the juſt judgement of God permitted for a puniſhment upon them: for as it is in the way of
<hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> one ſin is commonly the puniſhment of another, God moſt juſtly withdrawing the aſſiſtance of his divine grace from ſuch as wilfully tranſgreſs his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lawes:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peccatum, quod non per poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diluitur, mox ſuo pondere ad aliud trahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Greg.</note> 
                     <hi>So that when ſin</hi> (ſaith the Father) <hi>is not waſhed away with the tears of repentance, the weight thereof ſinks the ſoul into the puddle of following ſins: His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſins,</hi> Prov. 5.22. So it is in the way. of <hi>Error,</hi> they who receive not the truth in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>life</hi> thereof, which is ſound and ſincere obedience thereunto; <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.10,11,12. So <hi>Saul</hi> for his diſobedience, 1 Sam. 15.22,23. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.14. So
<hi>Ahab</hi> for his many abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, refuſed to ear hthe voice of the true Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> and liſtned to <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> to his own ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, 2 Chron. 18. And ſo <hi>Judas</hi> whoſe faith in Chriſt was never ſound, but his Religion lay in his purſe, not in his heart, was therefore ſuffered to be tempted, and eternally ruined by that temptation to betray his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>3. In reſpect of the ſound and <hi>ſincere profeſſors</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, God permits <hi>Hereſies</hi> for many uſeful and profitable reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe ſmaller errors and miſtakes, wherewithall<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115683:131"/>through ignorance, or miſperſwaſion the underſtandings of many good men are infected, might by the oppoſition of Hereſies be cleared, and done away, and the chaffe, by the fan of temptation be winnowed, and ſifted from the purer grain: ſo ſaith an ancient Father of the Church:<note place="margin">

<hi>error,</hi> leaves not the wicked perſon till he be ceaſed with the evill of <hi>puniſhment</hi> either <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>eternal:</hi> hence it comes to paſs, that <hi>Hereſie is both profitable and dangerous,</hi> as S. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Chry.

                     <hi>'tis uſeful and profitable in that thereby the truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are ſifted, tryed and known from the light, giddy, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit number of profeſſors; and 'tis dangerous in that many are thereby ſeduced and periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great danger of Hereſie and Schiſm will appear, if we conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The infectious nature</hi> of them, how eaſily this <hi>ſpiritual plague</hi> doth ſeaſe, and how faſt it cleaveth to the depraved ſoul of man: There is no queſtion, but if holy truth could be difcerned by mortal eyes, in its native beauty and luſtre, there is nothing that would ſo much attract and raviſh the ſoul, whether we reſpect the
<hi>cauſe</hi> thereof, as being a beam diſplaid from the divine light of heaven: or its <hi>effect,</hi> being the perfection, and joy of the higheſt faculty in man, <hi>the underſtanding:</hi> in both reſpects there's nothing ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and lovely in it ſelf, as holy <hi>Truth:</hi> that therefore which makes errors, and lies ſo plauſible, and
<hi>infectious,</hi> is not their own natural ſtamp and quality which is deformed and hateful, but the <hi>counterfeit dreſs</hi> of ſeeming Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115683:133"/>the Devil doth gild, and paint, and cover their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; nor could the devil ever obtrude his lies, and errors, but that they are gilded over with holy and religious expreſſions, and intermixt alſo with many wholſome and profitable truths: and thus doth this Prince of darkneſs <hi>transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> that he may at once both amuſe and betray the deceived ſouls of men, through a
<hi>ſpiritual</hi> to an <hi>eternal</hi> darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>But as <hi>ſin</hi> is the more ſinful and dangerous,<note place="margin">

                  <p>To this deſtructive quality of error, the holy profeſſions, and ſtrict auſtere outward actions of Heretiques do much conduce, no man ſo pure in their <hi>own eyes,</hi> none ſo ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure and holy, to the outward view of <hi>other mens eyes,</hi> none more zealous in their way, none ſo full of religious phraſes, and Scripture expreſſions: their <hi>croſſed armes, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt eyes, neglected geſtures, garb,</hi> and <hi>attire,</hi> ſeemingly beſpeak them men altogether weaned from the world, and whoſe converſation is in heaven;
<hi>Sed latet anguis in herba:</hi> when under all theſe fair, and goodly appearances, there lies ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſerpentine poyſon of error; falſhood, and lying vanity<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115683:133"/>of minde, they do not only hereby deceive themſelves, but mightily ſeduce, and deceive others alſo: For, <hi>there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>)<note place="margin">Chry.

                     <hi>does ſo much deſtroy Truth, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſs, as counterfeit truth, and feigned holineſs; for the evil which is manifeſt, is ſhun'd and avoided as evil; but evil covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhew of Good, is not therefore avoided, becauſe not known to be evil, but is received as good and holy: and doth therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that which is good by being intermixt therewith:</hi> And thus ſaith he, <hi>the ſervants of the Devil do moſt wickedly corrupt, and deprave the holy Chriſtian Religion, whileſt they pretend to be themſelves good Chriſtians:</hi> of whom our Lord therefore commands us to beware, ſaying,
<hi>Beware of falſe Prophets which come unto you in ſheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening woolves,</hi> Mat. 7.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The great danger of Hereſie, and Schiſm, will further appear, if we conſider that they are ever productive, and fruitful in all licentiouſneſs, and ſinfulneſs of heart, and life: for Hereſies being begotten by the Devil of the ſinful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men hearts as is already noted, cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have any other iſſue but of the ſame mold and temper, whereof they are themſelves begotten.</p>
                  <p>What ever therefore may be the external garbe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of holineſs, which Heretiques generally do put on, and how ever <hi>pure</hi> they may ſeem <hi>in their own eyes,</hi> yet are ſuch <hi>who are not waſhed from their filthineſs:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 30.12.</note> and however they may <hi>juſtifie themſelves</hi> with the Phariſee, yet are they not therefore juſt before God, but rather the further off from juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Some of them you ſhall hear to brag much, and boaſt of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and yet very fruitful in the luſts of the <hi>fleſh.</hi> For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whereas there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnal?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.3. To talk much againſt the vanities of the world, and to be themſelves world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded: for ſo faith S. <hi>John</hi> of falſe Prophets: They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them, 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4.5. To profeſs, and make a great ſhew of <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> and yet as S. <hi>Jude</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>The deſpiſe government and ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> verſ. 8.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115683:134"/>To be righteous and juſt perſons: and contrary to the rule of righteouſneſs, <hi>they render not to all men their due, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, fear to whom fear belongeth, honour to whom honour appertaineth,</hi> Rom. 13.7.</p>
                  <p>No men ordinarily profeſs more zeal to Religion then He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and to the pure worſhip of God <hi>in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> yet none do more maim, corrupt and deprave Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and undermine Gods holy worſhip: the greateſt heat of their zeal being laid out, and exerciſed in crying out againſt parts, and eſſential branches of Gods ſervice: ſome againſt Gods <hi>Commandements,</hi> others againſt the
<hi>Articles</hi> of the moſt holy Faith, others againſt that all-perfect form and pattern of devotion, the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> ſome againſt
<hi>publique prayers,</hi> others againſt the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> ſome are againſt the <hi>places,</hi> others againſt the <hi>times,</hi> others againſt the <hi>perſons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ſacred ſervice of God: and others ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rob him of the <hi>means,</hi> and
<hi>maintenance</hi> of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>James</hi> tels us, <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God, is to viſit the fatherleſs and widowes, and to keep our ſelves unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world,</hi> Jam. 1.27. And yet 'tis uſual with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, none more, to profeſs purity of Religion, and none leſſe charitable to the fatherleſs and widowes, whoſe number is increaſed by their cruelty, not relieved by their mercy: And as to the pollutions of the world, none more ſubtil and active to undermine their neighbours, and by covetouſneſs, injuſtice, falſe accuſations, and all unlawful and indirect means to deprive them of their means, eſtates, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Seditions,</hi> or Schiſms, are reckoned amongſt <hi>the fruits of the fleſh:</hi> becauſe both they proceed from fleſhly luſts, pride, covetiſe, &amp;c. and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo productive of many exorbitant and wicked works.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it poſſible but that all <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and heretical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions muſt needs produce looſe, ſinful, and diſſolute
<hi>actions:</hi> becauſe the acts of the underſtanding, and of the will are ſo nearly, and mixedly enterwoven, that the corruption of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115683:134"/>the one, doth ever corrupt and vitiate the other. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are few Hereſies, which either do not directly teach, or ſecretly imply ſome kinde of looſneſs, exorbitancy, and ſinfulneſs of action. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Ebionites</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaimed againſt the honour of virgin <hi>chaſtity:</hi> The <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholaitans</hi> would have all wives in common: The <hi>Manichees</hi> with their anceſtors, the diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> were all of looſe, diſſolute, licentious lives, of whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſpeaks, 2 Pet.
2.10. <hi>Yet they</hi> (i. e. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his diſciples)
<hi>walk after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſs, and deſpiſe government; preſumptuous are they, and ſelf-willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities.</hi> The <hi>Circumcellions</hi> were taught to lay violent hands upon themſelves, and the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> alſo. The
<hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and many other Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts of the ſame ſtamp, openly profeſs, that themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only people of God, have only right therefore to the creature, all others beſide themſelves being uſurpers of what they enjoy, and ſo 'tis no injuſtice in them to rob, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and diſpoſſeſs them of their goods and eſtates. The
<hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidians</hi> deny the neceſſity of good works, and ſo they may live as they liſt; and generally all Heretiques rail, revile, cenſure, judge, and condemn all that are not of their own minde and way, which are ſins of no ſmall account in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>And what elſe hath filled all Chriſtendome with factions, and ſeditions, with tumults and troubles, with maſſacres, wars, and bloudſhed, but firſt the broaching and belief of <hi>Hereſies</hi> and
<hi>lies,</hi> and renting the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt by uncharitable
<hi>excommunications,</hi> and <hi>ſchiſmatical ſeparations,</hi> both of
<hi>general</hi> Churches, and <hi>particular</hi> congregations each from other? We read not, that the <hi>Arrians,</hi> or the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> taught or profeſſed any thing that was for matter of action, ſinful, factious, and ſeditious: and yet the tumults and troubles, uncharitable cenſures, cruel perſecutions, that followed both the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the other, are too many to be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>It is the duty of all good Chriſtians to be <hi>meek, gentle, humble, patient, obedient</hi> to ſuperiors, &amp;c. and 'tis the duty
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115683:135"/>of all good Paſtors to exhort their people to the practiſe of theſe and the reſt of the fruits or graces of the Spirit: but Heretiques on the contrary part blow the trumpet of war, faction, diviſion, crying Down, down ſtill with this, and that, and tother piece of religious worſhip, which they brand with the loathed name of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> only becauſe it ſutes not with their deceived <hi>imaginations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Great is the danger of Hereſie and Schiſm, becauſe <hi>the ſpirit of Hereſie,</hi> and faction ſhuts out <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and robs the ſoul of all divine aſſiſtance in the waies of life. It is no marvel therefore that Heretiques are generally cruel, miſchievous, and evil perſons, ſince they are deprived of the grace of God, without which we can do nothing that good is: And <hi>Grace</hi> cannot live out of the company of her twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter, <hi>Truth:</hi> Grace and Truth flow from Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs, as <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>heat</hi> from the Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both which are ſo co-eſſential to the Sun it ſelf, that the one cannot have a being without the other. All er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors therefore, when through perverſneſs and wilfulneſs they are grown up to be Hereſies, as they blinde the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſo they harden the heart alſo, and provoke the moſt juſt God to give up ſuch perſons to <hi>a reprobate ſenſe,</hi> Rom 1.28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hereſie and Schiſm are the more dangerous in that the infection knowes no bounds or limits, but ſpreads and <hi>eats like a canker,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.17.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle 2 Tim.
2.17. or as a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren, which beginning in a ſmall unperceivable ſpot, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtill if it be not deſtroyed, till it overſpread and conſume the body: So 'tis in the way of <hi>Error,</hi> that which begins many times but with a ſmall ſcruple, if it be not wiſely ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, increaſes into ſuch erroneous opinions as are deſtructive to the main body of Religion, and being of a Church. Thus <hi>Montanus</hi> firſt began with the conceit of <hi>immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then to limit the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his followers, thence they fell into the ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and broke off communion with the whole Church of Chriſt, which proceeded at length to this monſtrous conceit among them, that only the houſe of <hi>Montanus</hi> was the true Church,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115683:135"/>and that <hi>Montanus</hi> himſelf was the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> even ſo amongſt us firſt the <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and then the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> both of the holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and divine
<hi>ſervice</hi> were firſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and then cryed down, and afterward pulled down alſo: firſt Chriſtian liberty is pretended, and then brutiſh diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and confuſion followes. The Church is free, 'tis moſt true, and not to be clog'd, and burthened with a number of needleſs, fruitleſs, inſignificant ceremonies, but yet not ſo free, as to be freed of all order, decency, reverence, unity, and uniformity in the publique ſervice of God: but that ſcrupulous and new fangled ſouls, when they once begin to doubt, and then leave the way of truth, like travellers that have loſt their way, wander up and down, and are as far, if not farther off their journeys end, then when firſt they left the high and beaten road.</p>
                  <p>It would be endleſs to reckon up the ſeveral Sects and monſtrous Hereſies, which have crept in amongſt us at this one gap firſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſchiſmatical deſertion of that publique form of prayer, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other rites and ceremonies inſtituted and commanded by the Church to be obſerved by all the obedient ſons, and faithful members thereof. One who hath computed the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which ſeven years agoe ſprung up from that time when the
<hi>Common-prayer</hi> was aboliſhed, ſayes, they have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the number, of what they were in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, and in his daies they were very neer fourſcore: and they are much multiplied ſince that time, and daily do increaſe; for <hi>evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.13. Nor muſt we hope for other, till the God of all <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> be pleaſed together with his <hi>Truth</hi> to reſtore <hi>unity,</hi> and

                  </p>
                  <p>To yeeld obedience to theſe ſeveral injunctions, and to
<hi>ſtand faſt in the true faith rooted, and built up therein,</hi> againſt the aſſaults of falſe and deceitful workers, theſe following directions will be uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To be well, and throughly inſtructed in the grounds and principles of holy Religion:</hi> For as no firm and durable buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can be raiſed without a good foundation laid; ſo no man can be built up in the moſt holy faith, and firmly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the truth, except the foundation and ground-work be firſt well, and ſurely laid in the right underſtanding and firm adherence to the principles of holy Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now the general ground, and foundation of all holy and ſaving Truth, is <hi>the word of God:</hi> or the divinely inſpired writings of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets in the <hi>old,</hi> and of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in the <hi>new</hi> Teſtament: <hi>Ye are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head corner ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.20.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe principles of holy truth contained in the Scriptures which are fundamental, are according to the doctrine of the Church reduced to five Heads: 1. <hi>Repentance.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith.</hi>

For whileſt Religion is not ſetled in the heart, and thence breaks forth into the actions of a holy life, but floats aloft in the fanſie, and deſcends no lower then the ear, or tongue, to hear and talk of it; thus it does but render the minde fickle, and apt to receive the impreſſion of every new and ſtrange opinion how erroneous ſoever, if it wear but the garments and appear in the colours of the Spirit of grace and truth.</p>
